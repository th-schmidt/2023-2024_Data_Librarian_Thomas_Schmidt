Makerspaces are, simply put, places where people gather to make things. Although that may sound like a simplistic definition, the things that can be created in a makerspace vary a great deal. Makerspaces can be high tech, low tech, and everything in between. A makerspace's offerings revolve around the needs of the community it serves, but the one thing all have in common is that they bring people together to share ideas. Typically, the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about mak- erspaces is 3D printing, but when it comes to what\u2019s going on in makerspaces around the world, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Makers create things, ideas, and concepts. Makers work in metal, wood, plastic, fabric, paper, and digital forms. From robotics to crocheting, there are no limits to your makerspace. Let your imagination run wild. In this chapter, we\u2019ll provide the information and ideas to get your maker-spaces up and running based on your unique populations and budgets. You\u2019ll find a myriad of ways to create your makerspace. You\u2019ll also discover ways to ensure your makerspace is fun and functional.","booktitle":"The makerspace librarian's sourcebook","journal":null,"tags":["greenbib"],"isbn":"9780838915042","id":"2e033978aa4971fb861cc33beb8c3bb7c\/bibgreen"},{"search_string":"makerspace","pup_type":"article","year":2020,"author_first":"Oliver, Kevin M.","authors":["Kevin M.

Linguistic analysis as a data mining technique holds promise for revealing different dimensions of learning exhibited by students in makerspaces. In this study, student reflections on makerspace projects were gathered in 2 formats over 2\u00a0years: private written assessments captured in the 3D GameLab gamification platform, and semi-public video-recorded assessments posted in the more social FlipGrid platform. Transcripts of student assessments were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) to generate 4 summary variables thought to inform makerspace outcomes of interest (i.e. analytical thinking, authenticity, clout, and emotional tone). Comparative findings indicate that written assessments may elicit more analytical thinking about maker projects compared with less analytical conversation in videos, while video assessments may elicit somewhat higher clout scores as evidence of social scaffolding along with a much more positive emotional tone. Recommendations are provided for layering assessment approaches to maximize the potential benefits of each format, including reflective writing for social spaces, in social groups, and about design processes and procedures.","booktitle":null,"journal":"International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education","tags":["assessment","outcomes","makerspace","learninganalytics","linguisticanalysis"],"isbn":null,"id":"2fb48ac2947255e4aca45f9dcc913a382\/ereidt"},{"search_string":"makerspace","pup_type":"standard","year":2017,"author_first":null,"authors":null,"author_count":0,"title":"The makerspace librarian's sourcebook","abstract":"The Makerspace Librarian's Sourcebook is an essential all-in-one guidebook to the maker realm written specifically for librarians.

Four objectives\u00a0 guided the study: what constituted makerspace in academic library, the level of awareness of makerspace by academic library benefits and challenges of adopting makerspace in libraries. The descriptive survey design was adopted and questionnaire was used for data collection. The population of the study comprised of professional and paraprofessional librarians of Ambrose University and University of Benin, from which a sample size of 119 was drawn using total enumeration sampling technique. Out of the 119 copies of questionnaire administered, 94 were retrieved and analyzed using simple percentage and frequency tables. Findings revealed that, the respondents were aware of what constitute makerspace which are library space, 3D printers, computers and projector. It was also discovered that, the respondents had a high level of awareness of makerspace in the library. Some of the benefits associated with the use of makerspace are: it facilitates group interaction, it improves knowledge and provides access to wide varieties of tools and technology. Some of the challenges encountered in the adoption of makerspace are training of academic library staff, security of makerspace gadgets, poor funding, erratic power supply, high cost and maintenance of equipment. It was however recommended that; librarians should make deliberate effort to explore the potentials in makerspace in the enhancement of their services and training should be conducted regularly to enhance librarian\u2019s skills in the use of ICTs Kingsley Efe OSAWARU, Angela Ishioma DIME and Emordi Herbert OKONJO 2020.

This new expanded service will serve our users in different ways: one Makerspace will focus further on digital skills by offering drone building classes, 3D printing and robotics; the second one will focus on more manual competences like sewing, stitching and hand-lettering but also embrace technology by offering a low-level introduction to photo and film making. The MakerBus will combine the best of both Makerspaces, offering modules in 3D printing, programming, sewing, and on top a small mobile workshop for fixing bikes and small electrical items, encouraging responsible consumption and less waste.

It is argued that current trends in society like DIY, sharing or the maker \r\nmovement have huge influence on the discussion of public library services in the \r\ndigital age. They also provide the groundwork for makerspaces and community \r\nbuilding as one of the main parts of future library services. This development is \r\ncombined with the urban gardening trend.\r\nOne main aspect of this thesis is the understanding, that urban gardening is an \r\nessential part of the digital age and not its counterpart. Urban gardening has lots of \r\ncharacteristics of the DIY and maker movement. Regarding urban gardening and \r\ncommunity gardens as makerspaces gives the basis to combine them with library \r\nservices. \r\nUrban gardening makerspaces are embedded in the ideas of the green library and \r\nthe sustainable library. Therefore, this thesis proposes a definition for ecological and \r\nsocietal sustainable library services. Afterwards the potentials of urban gardening and\r\npublic libraries and their role in urban development are highlighted. A guideline for \r\npublic libraries for creating their own urban gardening makerspaces completes this thesis.","booktitle":null,"journal":null,"tags":["greenbib"],"isbn":null,"id":"21d2cad7623d1d96f92d82f243092796c\/bibgreen"},{"search_string":"makerspace","pup_type":"article","year":2017,"author_first":"Han, Sang-Yeal","authors":["Sang-Yeal Han","Jaeheung Yoo","Hangjung Zo","Andrew P.

Werkst\u00e4tten erleben heutzutage eine unerwartete Renaissance. Der Sammelbegriff \u201eoffene Werkst\u00e4tten\u201c umfasst verschiedene Formen von\r\nInfrastrukturen zur gemeinsamen Nutzung von Mitteln f\u00fcr materielle Produktion und den offenen\r\nAustausch dar\u00fcber. Konkret handelt es sich um gemeinwohlorientierte Repair Caf\u00e9s, Siebdruckwerkst\u00e4tten und Fahrradreparaturinitiativen, aber auch um gewerblich orientierte FabLabs und Hackerspaces.\r\nDie gewachsene Bedeutung und die gestiegene Zahl der offenen Werkst\u00e4tten sind Ausdruck und\r\nErgebnis sich ver\u00e4ndernder Produktions- und Innovationsbedingungen in der Wirtschaft. Dezentralisierungsprozesse der stofflichen Produktion, die durch die technisch avancierten Auspr\u00e4gungen\r\noffener Werkst\u00e4tten vorangetrieben werden, k\u00f6nnen sich auch transformativ auf andere Branchen\r\nauswirken. Entsprechend dieser Dynamiken wurden offene Werkst\u00e4tten als vielschichtige Orte untersucht, um sowohl Nachhaltigkeits- als auch Innovationspotenziale in den Blick zu nehmen.\r\nIm Sommer 2015 richteten wir eine Befragung an 453 offene Werkst\u00e4tten in Deutschland, um deren Innovations- und Arbeitsprozesse genauer in den Blick zu nehmen. Auf der Basis eines Datensamples von 103 Antworts\u00e4tzen (R\u00fccklaufquote 23 %) rekonstruiert die vorliegende Studie die\r\nsozialen, materiellen und \u00f6konomischen Wirkungsprozesse in diesen Werkst\u00e4tten.\r\nDie starke Dynamik des Ph\u00e4nomens zeigt sich unter anderem daran, dass die meisten Antwortenden der offenen Werkstatt zwischen 2013 und 2015 beigetreten sind. \u00dcber die H\u00e4lfte hat ihre\r\nWerkstatt selbst mitbegr\u00fcndet. Der \u00fcberwiegende Teil besitzt eine naturwissenschaftliche Qualifikation.\r\nGemeinschaftsorientierung \u2013 nicht das materielle Endergebnis oder die Herstellung eines Gegenstandes \u2013 ist der Hauptgrund f\u00fcr das Engagement in offenen Werkst\u00e4tten. Die pers\u00f6nliche Motivation der Aktiven liegt weniger im \u00f6konomischen Bereich als vielmehr in der Vermittlung von Wissen, dem praktischen Arbeiten und in einer gesellschaftlichen Transformation. Das Erproben neuer sozialer Wege des Lernens, der Wissensvermittlung und des Zusammenarbeitens stehen im Mittelpunkt allt\u00e4glicher Praktiken in offenen Werkst\u00e4tten.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nLately, there is a noticeable trend that people start doing handicrafts again. And thus open workshops experience an unexpected renaissance. The term \u201copen workshops\u201d comprises different\r\nkinds of infrastructures for the shared use of resources for material production and an open exchange about it. This includes non-commercial repair caf\u00e9s, screen printing workshops and initiatives for bicycle repair as well as commercially oriented fab labs and hackerspaces.\r\nThe growing number and importance of open workshops are the result of changing economic conditions for production and innovation. The decentralization of physical production, which is promoted by the technically advanced types of open workshops, may also have transformative effects\r\non other sectors. Multiple aspects of open workshops were investigated to assess the potentials of\r\nthese dynamics for sustainability and innovation.\r\nTo investigate the work and innovation activivties, 453 open workshops in Germany were addressed by an empirical survey in the summer 2015. Based on a data sample of 103 observations\r\n(which corresponds to a response rate of 23 %), the social, material and economic processes\r\nwithin open workshops have been reconstructed.\r\nThe strong dynamics of this phenomenon is demonstrated by the fact that the majority of the respondents joined the open workshops between 2013 and 2015. More than half of them are cofounders of the workshop. Predominantly, respondents have an educational background in natural\r\nsciences.\r\nCommunity-orientation \u2013 not the material end result or the fabrication of an object \u2013 is the principal\r\nreason for engaging in open workshops. The personal motivations of the actors are not primarily\r\neconomic, but rather directed towards the transfer of knowledge, practical working experiences and\r\nsocietal transformation.

Ironically, rate of participation in FOSS-related work is far lower than in other areas of computing. A 2002 European Union study showed that fewer than 2 percent of software developers in the FOSS world were women.

The traditional standard of keyboard and mouse is not the only way we have to communicate with our computers anymore. We have entered the age of the personal digital assistant, which can deliver results with nothing but a voice command. Some of the largest technology companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon) believe that the digital agent will eventually be the primary interface we use to communicate with our computerized gadgets, the internet, and our network of interconnected devices (Internet of Things). With that belief in mind, these companies are attempting to make their version of a digital agent the de facto standard for most consumers. Each company is looking to establish a foothold in this marketspace because they believe digital agent technology is the key that will hold consumers in their respective digital ecosystems. In other words, once you use a particular digital agent and establish a connection with the software, it will be difficult to switch to a different digital agent.

Here we test whether metrics generated by a virtual reality surgical simulation can differentiate between three levels of experience, namely novices, otolaryngology residents, and experienced qualified surgeons.Cohort study.Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital.Twenty-seven participants were recruited. There were 12 experts, six residents, and nine novices. After orientation, participants were asked to perform a modified radical mastoidectomy on the simulator. Comparisons of time taken, injury to structures, and forces exerted were made between the groups to determine which specific metrics would discriminate experience levels.Experts completed the simulated task in significantly shorter time than the other two groups (experts 22 minutes, residents 36 minutes, and novices 46 minutes; P = 0.001). Novices exerted significantly higher average forces when dissecting close to vital structures compared with experts (0.24 Newton N vs 0.13 N, P = 0.002). Novices were also more likely to injure structures such as dura compared to experts (23 injuries vs 3 injuries, P = 0.001). Compared with residents, the experts modulated their force between initial cortex dissection and dissection close to vital structures. Using the combination of these metrics, we were able to correctly classify the participants' level of experience 90 percent of the time.This preliminary study shows that measurements of performance obtained from within a virtual reality simulator can differentiate between levels of users' experience. These results suggest that simulator training may have a role in temporal bone training beyond foundational training.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","tags":["t-vr-sim","melbourne"],"isbn":null,"id":"26925742c2ed5efd63a6fd6639686dec9\/stevenarild"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2021,"author_first":"Gl\u00e9marec, Yann","authors":["Yann Gl\u00e9marec","Jean-Luc Lugrin","Anne-Gwenn Bosser","Aryana Collins Jackson","C\u00e9dric Buche","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":6,"title":"Indifferent or Enthusiastic? Virtual Audiences Animation and Perception in Virtual Reality","abstract":"In this paper, we present a virtual audience simulation system for Virtual Reality (VR). The system implements an audience perception model controlling the nonverbal behaviors of virtual spectators, such as facial expressions or postures. Groups of virtual spectators are animated by a set of nonverbal behavior rules representing a particular audience attitude (e.g., indifferent or enthusiastic). Each rule specifies a nonverbal behavior category: posture, head movement, facial expression and gaze direction as well as three parameters: type, frequency and proportion. In a first user-study, we asked participants to pretend to be a speaker in VR and then create sets of nonverbal behaviour parameters to simulate different attitudes. Participants manipulated the nonverbal behaviours of single virtual spectator to match a specific levels of engagement and opinion toward them. In a second user-study, we used these parameters to design different types of virtual audiences with our nonverbal behavior rules and evaluated their perceptions. Our results demonstrate our system\u2019s ability to create virtual audiences with three types of different perceived attitudes: indifferent, critical, enthusiastic. The analysis of the results also lead to a set of recommendations and guidelines regarding attitudes and expressions for future design of audiences for VR therapy and training applications.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Virtual Reality","tags":["myown","lugrin","vraudi"],"isbn":null,"id":"268cd711d92b3f27bfffa2412945ce860\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2009,"author_first":"Gurusamy, K S","authors":["K S Gurusamy","R Aggarwal","L Palanivelu","B R Davidson"],"author_count":4,"title":"Virtual reality training for surgical trainees in laparoscopic surgery","abstract":"Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is time consuming, costly, and of variable effectiveness. Training using a virtual reality simulator is an option to supplement standard training.To determine whether virtual reality training can supplement or replace conventional laparoscopic surgical training (apprenticeship) in surgical trainees with limited or no prior laparoscopic experience.We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and grey literature until March 2008.We included all randomised clinical trials comparing virtual reality training versus other forms of training including video trainer training, no training, or standard laparoscopic training in surgical trainees with little or no prior laparoscopic experience. We also included trials comparing different methods of virtual reality training.We collected the data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality of the trials, mortality, morbidity, conversion rate, operating time, and hospital stay. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis.We included 23 trials with 612 participants. Four trials compared virtual reality versus video trainer training. Twelve trials compared virtual reality versus no training or standard laparoscopic training. Four trials compared virtual reality, video trainer training and no training, or standard laparoscopic training. Three trials compared different methods of virtual reality training. Most of the trials were of high risk of bias. In trainees without prior surgical experience, virtual reality training decreased the time taken to complete a task, increased accuracy, and decreased errors compared with no training; virtual reality group was more accurate than video trainer training group. In the participants with limited laparoscopic experience, virtual reality training reduces operating time and error better than standard in the laparoscopic training group; composite operative performance score was better in the virtual reality group than in the video trainer group.Virtual reality training can supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training of apprenticeship and is at least as effective as video trainer training in supplementing standard laparoscopic training. Further research of better methodological quality and more patient-relevant outcomes are needed.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","tags":["cochrane","gensurg","vrsim"],"isbn":null,"id":"28463afafe48b0eb46f42600ae0799185\/stevenarild"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":1992,"author_first":"Miller, Carmen","authors":["Carmen Miller"],"author_count":1,"title":"Virtual reality and online databases : will \"Look and Feel\" literally mean \"Look\" and \"Feel\"? and\u00d6nline\" Interviews Dr. Thomas A.

In the case of the honeybee Apis mellifera, this possibility may fill the gap between behavioural analyses in free-flight and cellular analyses in the laboratory. Using automated, computer-controlled systems, it is possible to generate virtual stimuli or even entire environments that can be modified to test hypotheses on bee visual behaviour. The bee itself can remain tethered in place, making it possible to record neural activity while the bees is performing behavioural tasks. Recent studies have examined visual navigation and attentional processes in VR on flying or walking tethered bees, but experimental paradigms for examining visual learning and memory are only just emerging. Behavioural performances of bees under current experimental conditions are often lower in VR than in natural environments, but further improvements on current experimental protocols seem possible. Here we discuss current developments and conclude that it is essential to tailor the specifications of the VR simulation to the visual processing of honeybees to improve the success of this research endeavour.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Current Opinion in Insect Science","tags":["schultheiss_high"],"isbn":null,"id":"257a35e451595a826a7af75d210ec3c2b\/zoologieii"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2009,"author_first":"Pfeiffer, Thies","authors":["Thies Pfeiffer","Marc Erich Latoschik","Ipke Wachsmuth"],"author_count":3,"title":"Evaluation of Binocular Eye Trackers and Algorithms for 3D Gaze Interaction in Virtual Reality Environments","abstract":"Tracking user\u2019s visual attention is a fundamental aspect in novel human-computer interaction paradigms found in Virtual Reality.

Realism, training effectiveness, and global impressions were evaluated across 21 domains using a 5-point Likert-type scale. A score of 4 was the minimum threshold for acceptability.The experienced group comprised 25 otolaryngology trainers who had performed 150 mastoid operations. The referent group comprised 60 trainees (mean otolaryngology experience of 2.9 years). Familiarization took longer in the experienced group (P = .01). User-friendliness was positively rated (mean score 4.1). Seventy percent of participants rated anatomical appearance as acceptable. Trainers rated drill ergonomics worse than did trainees (P = .01). Simulation temporal bone training scored highly (mean score 4.3). Surgical anatomy, drill navigation, and hand-eye coordination accounted for this. Trainees were more likely to recommend temporal bone simulation to a colleague than were trainers (P = .01). Transferability of skills to the operating room was undecided (mean score 3.5).Realism of the VOXEL-MAN virtual reality temporal bone simulator is suboptimal in its current version. Nonetheless, it represents a useful adjunct to existing training methods and is particularly beneficial for novice surgeons before performing cadaveric temporal bone dissection.

It is indeed a critical limitation of a number of existing systems that they rely on a Wizard of Oz approach, where the tutor drives the audience in reaction to the user\u2019s performance. We address this problem by integrating with a VAS a high-level control component for tutors, which allows using predefined audience behavior rules, defining custom ones, as well as intervening during run-time for finer control of the unfolding of the pedagogical plan. At its core, this component offers a tool to program, select, modify and monitor interactive training narratives using a high-level representation. \r\nThe STAGE offers the following features: i) a high-level API to program pedagogical narratives focusing on a specific public speaking situation and training objectives, ii) an interactive visualization interface iii) computation and visualization of user metrics, iv) a semi-autonomous virtual audience composed of virtual spectators with automatic reactions to the speaker and surrounding spectators while following the pedagogical plan V) and the possibility for the instructor to embody a virtual spectator to ask questions or guide the speaker from within the Virtual Environment.

The industrial research project Avionic Digital Service Platform (AVIGLE) explores novel approaches to remote sensing by using a swarm of MUAVs, which are equipped with different sensing and network technologies. The acquired data will be sent in quasi-real time to a flight ground control station, where a virtual environment will be generated automatically.

The task involved identification and delineation of the sigmoid sinus in a virtual left-sided temporal bone.Objective data were produced using a scoring matrix incorporated into the VOXEL MAN TempoSurg software. The simulator measured the total time taken to complete the task, the volume and efficiency of bone removal and error data for excessive force or injury to the facial nerve, dura, and sigmoid sinus.Experts and intermediates outperformed novices with respect to the total time taken to complete the task (expert versus novice: p < 0.001; intermediate versus novice: p < 0.001), total volume of bone removed (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03), efficiency of bone removal (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001), time spent with the drill tip obscured (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001), and number of injuries to the sigmoid sinus (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The intermediate group injured the sigmoid sinus on more occasions than the experts (p = 0.008) and were less efficient than experienced surgeons (p = 0.005).Simulator-generated objective metrics can be used to differentiate individuals of differing levels of experience using a standardized temporal bone task.

When developing VR applications, developers should be able to focus on modeling advanced interaction and system behavior instead of rendering issues. Many systems and tools for developing virtual reality applications have been proposed to achieve this goal. However, no de facto standard is available. In this paper we present Virtual Reality VRS (VR2S), a generic VR software system, which is an extension of the high-level rendering system VRS. The system provides flexibility in terms of the rendering system and the user interface toolkit. Thus, with using VR2S\u00c2  rendering can be performed with several low-level rendering APIs such as OpenGL, RenderMan or ray-tracing systems, and the interface can be implemented by arbitrary user interface toolkits to support both desktop- and VR-based interaction. The proposed system meets the demands of VR developers as well as users and has demonstrated its potential in different planning and exploration applications.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Artificial Reality and Telexistence (ICAT05)","journal":null,"tags":["objects","stadtmodellen","virtualreality","interactive"],"isbn":null,"id":"295da58c57dd792054066551ee98ec2d5\/mcm"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2007,"author_first":"Magoulas, George D.","authors":["George D.

We hypothesized that both computerized analysis and expert ratings would discriminate the performance of novices from experienced trainees. We also hypothesized that performance on the virtual reality temporal bone simulator (VR TB) would differentiate based on previous drilling experience.The authors conducted a randomized, blind assessment study.Nineteen volunteers from the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery training program at the University of Toronto drilled both a cadaveric TB and a simulated VR TB. Expert reviewers were asked to assess operative readiness of the trainee based on a blind video review of their performance. Computerized hand motion analysis of each participant's performance was conducted.Expert raters were able to discriminate novices from experienced trainees (P < .05) on cadaveric temporal bones, and there was a trend toward discrimination on VR TB performance. Hand motion analysis showed that experienced trainees had better movement economy than novices (P < .05) on the VR TB.Performance, as measured by hand motion analysis on the VR TB simulator, reflects trainees' previous drilling experience. This study suggests that otolaryngology trainees could accomplish initial temporal bone training on a VR TB simulator, which can provide feedback to the trainee, and may reduce the need for constant faculty supervision and evaluation.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Laryngoscope","tags":["voxelman","t-vr-sim"],"isbn":null,"id":"2c1b7a5d01c53638fa617400f58351531\/stevenarild"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2007,"author_first":"Barfield, Woodrow","authors":["Woodrow Barfield"],"author_count":1,"title":"The right of publicity in virtual reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"216c1d085bbe945b02274a6e71038cc2d\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2009,"author_first":"Luciano, Cristian","authors":["Cristian Luciano","Pat P.

In addition, specific hardware devices of Virtual Reality (VR) often ship with built-in sensors, i.e. eye-tracking and movements sensors. Hence, the combination of physiological measurements and VR applications seems promising. Several approaches have investigated the applicability and benefits of this combination for various fields of applications. However, the range of possible application fields, coupled with potentially useful and beneficial physiological parameters, types of sensor, target variables and factors, and analysis approaches and techniques is manifold. This article provides a systematic overview and an extensive state-of-the-art review of the usage of physiological measurements in VR. We identified 1,119 works that make use of physiological measurements in VR. Within these, we identified 32 approaches that focus on the classification of characteristics of experience, common in VR applications. The first part of this review categorizes the 1,119 works by field of application, i.e. therapy, training, entertainment, and communication and interaction, as well as by the specific target factors and variables measured by the physiological parameters. An additional category summarizes general VR approaches applicable to all specific fields of application since they target typical VR qualities. In the second part of this review, we analyze the target factors and variables regarding the respective methods used for an automatic analysis and, potentially, classification. For example, we highlight which measurement setups have been proven to be sensitive enough to distinguish different levels of arousal, valence, anxiety, stress, or cognitive workload in the virtual realm. This work may prove useful for all researchers wanting to use physiological data in VR and who want to have a good overview of prior approaches taken, their benefits and potential drawbacks.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Virtual Reality","tags":["myown","hci-uwb","via-vr"],"isbn":null,"id":"2371e6023cd028c08d54791cf0706e2ef\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2011,"author_first":"Seth, Abhishek","authors":["Abhishek Seth","Judy M.

To tackle this challenging issue, we conducted an experiment wherein participants learned an immersive virtual environment using a joystick. The following day, participants' brain activity was monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging while they mentally estimated distances in this environment. Results were compared with that of participants performing the same task but having learned the real version of the environment by actual walking. We detected a large set of areas shared by both groups including the parieto-frontal areas and the parahippocampal gyrus. More importantly, although participants of both groups performed the same mental task and exhibited similar behavioral performances, they differed at the brain activity level. Unlike real learners, virtual learners activated a left-lateralized network associated with tool manipulation and action semantics. This demonstrated that a neural fingerprint distinguishing virtual from real learning persists when subjects use a mental representation of the learnt environment with equivalent performances.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Human Brain Mapping","tags":["mapping","virtual","reality","cognition","games","spatial","neurosome","fmri","neuropsychology","brain"],"isbn":null,"id":"27b620f21730082932b1ade3c7315a3df\/yish"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2022,"author_first":"D\u00f6llinger, Nina","authors":["Nina D\u00f6llinger","Erik Wolf","David Mal","Stephan Wenninger","Mario Botsch","Marc Erich Latoschik","Carolin Wienrich"],"author_count":7,"title":"Resize Me!

Thirteen children aged 8--13 years comprised the study group. Children attended eight one-hour virtual reality play sessions in which they were immersed and interacted with virtual reality. The Test of Playfulness (TOP) was used as the measure to assess playfulness. Participants were videotaped while they played during 12 different environments over the course of their intervention time. Three randomly selected virtual reality play sessions were chosen to score three different virtual reality environments within each session yielding a total of nine trials (environments) for each participant. The types of virtual environments varied across participants. Overall, the different virtual reality play environments produced varying levels of playfulness according to the TOP's four different subscale scores. Motivation ranged from 1.50 to 2.25, internal control ranged from 1.00 to 1.88, suspension of reality ranged from 0 to 0.26, and framing ranged from 1.33 to 1.78. The three environments producing the highest playfulness ratings were called Paint, Trip and Island Sounds. These environments allowed creativity, persistence with the task, pleasure, and a certain degree of control. Two environments did not appear to foster playfulness. A possible reason was that these environments were too unpredictable and frustrating for participants. These results will be useful for creating new virtual reality software applications that will encourage playfulness in children with disabilities","booktitle":null,"journal":"Occupational Therapy International","tags":["print-red","children","virtual-reality","play","vr","pilot","cp"],"isbn":null,"id":"23911dd5794fea119bd1ea793febd3eca\/willwade"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"proceedings","year":2014,"author_first":null,"authors":null,"author_count":0,"title":"IEEE 7th Workshop on Software Engineering and Architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems (SEARIS)","abstract":"SEARIS provides a forum for researchers and practitioners working on the design, development, and support of realtime interactive systems (RIS).

The proposed procedure will evaluate the patient's response to the visual and auditory stimuli, provided via a VR device. We will highlight the functionality of the setup, its advantages and shortcomings, and discuss possible risks of the used technology. Our approach provides a complete virtual environment, including situations and combinations of stimuli that can test complex reactions of the patient, and, on the other hand, is completely under control of the neuropsychologist. We conclude by showing that the benefits of the approach significantly outweigh the downsides, so that the presented technology is not only a new opportunity, but also the future.","booktitle":"GLOBAL HEALTH 2021","journal":null,"tags":["myown","Patient_Feedback","Virtual_Reality","Awake_Craniotomy"],"isbn":"9781612088921","id":"2d39bd701e8fb809ffb2e9aea18e32ee5\/holst"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2023,"author_first":"Chukwu, Matthew N.

Embodiment and Perception of Personalized Avatars in Relation to the Self-Observation Distance in Virtual Reality","abstract":"Virtual reality applications employing avatar embodiment typically use virtual mirrors to allow users to perceive their digital selves not only from a first-person perspective but also from a holistic third-person view. However, due to distance-related biases such as the distance compression effect or a reduced relative rendering resolution, the self-observation distance (SOD) between the user and the virtual mirror might influence how users perceive their embodied avatar. Our article systematically investigates the effects of a short (1 meter), middle (2.5 meter), and far (4 meter) SOD between user and mirror on the perception of personalized and self-embodied avatars. The avatars were photorealistic reconstructed using state-of-the-art photogrammetric methods. Thirty participants were repeatedly exposed to their real-time animated self-embodied avatars in each of the three SOD conditions. In each condition, the personalized avatars were repeatedly altered in their body weight, and participants were asked to judge the (1) sense of embodiment, (2) body weight perception, and (3) affective appraisal towards their avatar. We found that the different SODs are unlikely to influence any of our measures except for the perceived body weight estimation difficulty. Here, the participants judged the difficulty significantly higher for the farthest SOD. We further found that the participants' self-esteem significantly impacted their ability to modify their avatar's body weight to their current body weight and that it positively correlated with the perceived attractiveness of the avatar. Additionally, the participants' concerns about their body shape affected how eerie they perceived their avatars. Both measures influenced the perceived body weight estimation difficulty. For practical application, we conclude that the virtual mirror in embodiment scenarios can be freely placed and varied at a distance of one to four meters from the user without expecting major effects on the perception of the avatar.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Virtual Reality","tags":["ewolf","myown","emlab","vitras","dmal"],"isbn":null,"id":"22f4c83464c82950712a728283aa66443\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2017,"author_first":"Wu, Chien-Min","authors":["Chien-Min Wu","Chih-Wen Hsu","Tzu-Kuei Lee","Shana Smith"],"author_count":4,"title":"A virtual reality keyboard with realistic haptic feedback in a fully immersive virtual environment.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2d8359ea338410c0432a8c5216650ae69\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2006,"author_first":"Badni, Kevin","authors":["Kevin Badni"],"author_count":1,"title":"Virtual reality design techniques for web-based historical reconstructions.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2b32a1bbcbe48b2ab488c82f901f467fa\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2006,"author_first":"Roussou, Maria","authors":["Maria Roussou","Martin Oliver","Mel Slater"],"author_count":3,"title":"The virtual playground: an educational virtual reality environment for evaluating interactivity and conceptual learning.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"25e849ff27fc7e216f2a354c5e6b71faa\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2009,"author_first":"Steinicke, Frank","authors":["Frank Steinicke","Gerd Bruder","Brian Ries","Klaus H.

The principal factors responsible for this phenomenon have remained largely unknown. However, recent experiments suggest that when the virtual environment (VE) is an exact replica of a user's real physical surroundings, the person's distance perception improves. Furthermore, it has been shown that when users start their virtual reality (VR) experience in such a virtual replica and then gradually transition to a different VE, their sense of presence in the actual virtual world increases significantly. In this case the virtual replica serves as a transitional environment between the real and virtual world. In this paper we examine whether a person's distance estimation skills can be transferred from a transitional environment to a different VE. We have conducted blind walking experiments to analyze if starting the VR experience in a transitional environment can improve a person's ability to estimate distances in an immersive VR system. We found that users significantly improve their distance estimation skills when they enter the virtual world via a transitional environment.","booktitle":"Symposium on Applied Perception in Graphics and Visualization","journal":null,"tags":["objects","virtual","stadtmodellen","virtualreality","interactive"],"isbn":null,"id":"25bf4c407475b64bc36c6b6090f63416f\/mcm"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":1994,"author_first":"Vasilakis, Christina","authors":["Christina Vasilakis"],"author_count":1,"title":"User Studies for Toolkit Development in Virtual Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"PPIG","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2ca903f93168e0b23e9510f2e6f229fac\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2021,"author_first":"Wienrich, Carolin","authors":["Carolin Wienrich","Nina D\u00f6llinger","Rebecca Hein"],"author_count":3,"title":"Behavioral Framework of Immersive Technologies (BehaveFIT): How and Why Virtual Reality can Support Behavioral Change Processes","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Virtual Reality.

In this paper we address the challenge to allow users to interact with stereoscopically displayed virtual environments when the input is constrained to a 2D touch surface. During interaction with a large-scale touch display a user changes between three different states: (1) beyond the arm-reach distance from the surface, (2) at arm-reach distance and (3) interaction. We have analyzed the user\u2019s ability to discriminate stereoscopic display parallaxes while she moves through these states, i. e., if objects can be imperceptibly shifted onto the interactive surface and become accessible for natural touch interaction. Our results show that the detection thresholds for such manipulations are related to both user motion and stereoscopic parallax, and that users have problems to discriminate whether they touched an object or not, when tangible feedback is expected.","booktitle":"Proceedings of Joint Virtual Reality Conference (JVRC 2010)","journal":null,"tags":["based","LOCUI","objects","touching","floating","projection"],"isbn":null,"id":"2fd89d13461c9c7e4ad55c7948f6f45fb\/mcm"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"conference","year":2019,"author_first":"Mridul, Kumar","authors":["Kumar Mridul","M.

Such AS displays allow to view stereoscopic content without requiring special glasses. Unfortunately, until now simultaneous monoscopic and stereoscopic display was not possible. Hence prior work on fish tank VR systems focussed either on 2D or 3D interactions. In this paper we introduce so called interscopic interaction concepts providing an improved working experience, which enable great potentials in terms of the interaction between 2D elements, which may be displayed either in monoscopic or stereoscopic, e.g., GUI items, and the 3D virtual environment usually displayed stereoscopically. We present a framework which is based on a software layer between the operating system and its graphical user interface supporting the display of both mono- as well as stereoscopic content in arbitrary regions of an autostereoscopic display. The proposed concepts open up new vistas for the interaction in environments where essential parts of the GUI are displayed monoscopically and other parts are rendered stereoscopically. We address some essential issues of such fish tank VR systems and introduce intuitive interaction concepts which we have realized.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Virtual Reality Conference (VR2007)","journal":null,"tags":["concepts","fish","interscopic","user","interface"],"isbn":null,"id":"2e203600c5534f92d188beb5c52e42d3e\/mcm"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2014,"author_first":"Donalek, Ciro","authors":["Ciro Donalek","S.

Visualization is also essential in the data mining process, directing the choice of the applicable algorithms, and in helping to identify and remove bad data from the analysis. However, a high complexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical obstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may exist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can perceive and interact with multidimensional information poses some deep questions in the field of cognition technology and human-computer interaction. To this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms for scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity hardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi-dimensional data visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their data and their colleagues in the same visual space.

To accomplish this, a user study was conducted to identify user preferences for tailored content descriptions, track user viewing behavior to gauge their interest in a VR exhibition, and determine preferred methods of information gathering. The study involved 31 participants, and the findings are expected to provide valuable insights for designing effective and engaging VR exhibitions that cater to diverse visitor interests.","booktitle":"Adjunct Proceedings of the 31st ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization","journal":null,"tags":["virtual-reality","art-recommender","eye-tracking","umap2023"],"isbn":null,"id":"234d54844da67c52a22018040743e48eb\/brusilovsky"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":1996,"author_first":"Nishino, Takanori","authors":["Takanori Nishino","Sumie Mase","Shoji Kajita","Kazuya Takeda","Fumitada Itakura"],"author_count":5,"title":"Interpolating HRTF for auditory virtual reality","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","tags":["imported","interpolation","hrtf"],"isbn":null,"id":"26f393155b3634e00f1760994d165082d\/darnok"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2005,"author_first":"Li, Lei","authors":["Lei Li","Maojun Zhang","Fangjiang Xu","Shaohua Liu"],"author_count":4,"title":"ERT-VR: an immersive virtual reality system for emergency rescue training.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"25d5b4129f8f2ea4002794eb1545f4d59\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2007,"author_first":"Liarokapis, Fotis","authors":["Fotis Liarokapis"],"author_count":1,"title":"An augmented reality interface for visualizing and interacting with virtual content.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"282c9dcf2f90c352422bea82c4bd7a816\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2007,"author_first":"Heldal, Ilona","authors":["Ilona Heldal"],"author_count":1,"title":"Supporting participation in planning new roads by using virtual reality systems.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"26252a9656730f6c3afb45d85afaff888\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2018,"author_first":"Crocetta, T.B.","authors":["T.B.

In order to improve a goalkeeper's training by allowing insights into their complex perception, learning and action processes, virtual reality (VR) technologies provide a way to standardize experimental sport situations. In this poster we describe a VR-based handball system, which supports the evaluation of perceptual-motor skills of handball goalkeepers during shots. In order to allow reliable analyses it is essential that goalkeepers can move naturally like they would do in a real game situation, which is often inhibited by wires or markers that are usually used in VR systems. To address this challenge, we developed a camera-based goalkeeper analysis system, which allows to detect and measure motions of goalkeepers in real-time.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the Joint Virtual Reality Conference of EuroVR - EGVE - VEC","journal":null,"tags":["LOCUI","virtual","goalkeeper","reality","handball","analysis"],"isbn":null,"id":"242fffe4321ffc438364eaabbcaaf5e28\/mcm"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2012,"author_first":"Aleotti, Jacopo","authors":["Jacopo Aleotti","Stefano Caselli"],"author_count":2,"title":"Grasp programming by demonstration in virtual reality with automatic environment reconstruction.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2685af0e4192acb88b2df2686c666bcd7\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2019,"author_first":"Caserman, Polona","authors":["Polona Caserman","Augusto Garcia-Agundez","Robert Konrad","Stefan G\u00f6bel","Ralf Steinmetz"],"author_count":5,"title":"Real-time body tracking in virtual reality using a Vive tracker.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2825493ac4d5b49473905adcf66ad55eb\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2016,"author_first":"Bissonnette, Josiane","authors":["Josiane Bissonnette","Francis Dub\u00e9","Martin D.

Common solutions are based on specialised software and\/or hardware capable of rendering 3D content, which not only restricts accessibility to specific platforms but also increases the barrier for non expert users. Our approach addresses new audiences by making existing Virtual Environments (VEs) ubiquitously accessible. Its appeal is that a large variety of clients, like desktop PCs and handhelds, are ready to connect to VEs out of the box. We achieve this combining established videoconferencing protocol standards with a server based interaction handling. Currently interaction is based on natural speech, typed textual input and visual feedback, but extensions to support natural gestures are possible and planned.

These phenomena have been observed in both computer-generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper, we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic virtual reality (VR) systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for semiimmersive VR systems, i.e., a passive and active stereoscopic projection system as well as an immersive VR system, i.e., a head-mounted display, and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.","booktitle":null,"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)","tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"293f3bdcd9c73d2ebab81f4ac85b35ffd\/mcm"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2019,"author_first":"Dickinson, Patrick","authors":["Patrick Dickinson","Kathrin Gerling","Kieran Hicks","John C.

We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systems\u00e2\u20ac\u0090related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics.\nIn previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This work\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 mshop provides a face\u00e2\u20ac\u0090to\u00e2\u20ac\u0090face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems RIS. Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as real\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepa\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current state\u00e2\u20ac\u0090of\u00e2\u20ac\u0090the\u00e2\u20ac\u0090art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sum\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 omarize the work our community is doing.\n\nArranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop\\u0027s goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections:\n\n* Systems.

Two papers address the issues of reusable VE platforms and alterna tives to scene graphs. \n* Special Issues.

We compared immersive virtual reality (VR), video see-through augmented reality (VST AR), and optical see-through AR (OST AR). The personalized virtual alter egos were generated by state-of-the-art photogrammetry methods. 42 participants were repeatedly exposed to animated versions of their 3D-reconstructed virtual alter egos in each of the three XR display conditions. The reconstructed virtual alter egos were additionally modified in body weight for each repetition. We show that the display types lead to different degrees of incongruence between the renderings of the virtual humans and the presentation of the respective environmental backgrounds, leading to significant effects of perceived mismatches as part of a plausibility measurement. The device-related effects were further partly confirmed by subjective misestimations of the modified body weight and the measured spatial presence. Here, the exceedingly incongruent OST AR condition leads to the significantly highest weight misestimations as well as to the lowest perceived spatial presence.

Conceptual design has not benefited from these sophisticated and highly precise software tools to the same degree because the creative activities associated with developing and communicating potential solutions with minimal details is far less formulaic in its implementation. At the early stages of product design the specifications and constraints have not been fully established. The industrial designers and engineers need the freedom to change and modify the product configuration and mechanical behavior to investigate a wide range of alternative solutions. Any CAD system that seeks to support and enhance conceptual design must, therefore, enable natural and haptic modes of human-computer interaction.

The traditional group were to receive addition teaching via traditional teaching methods such as small group tutorials, videos, and models. The VR group received supervised teaching on the VR simulator. At the end of their teaching they were asked to perform a cadaveric temporal bone dissection and had their performance videoed and assessed by blinded assessors. The assessors judged the videos on four domains of assessments looking at the end product, injury size, overall performance, and technique. These assessments were based on the Welling's scale and OSATS.The VR group performed significantly better in the end product of the dissection (VR 80% vs. traditional 45%, P-value <.001) and caused smaller injuries to anatomic structures (VR 19% vs. traditional 36%, P-value = .01). They also did better in the overall performance score (VR 55% vs. traditional 35%, P-value = .04) There were no differences in the technique score.

Redgraph is capable of handling large data-sets, as we demonstrate on social network data from the U.S. Patent Trade Office. We develop a Semantic Web vocabulary of virtual reality terms compatible with GraphXML to map graph visualization into the Semantic Web itself. Our approach to visualizing Semantic Web data takes advantage of user-interaction in an immersive environment to bypass a number of difficult issues in 3-dimensional graph visualization layout by relying on users themselves to interactively extrude the nodes and links of a 2-dimensional graph into the third dimension. When users touch nodes in the virtual reality environment, they retrieve data formatted according to the data\u2019s schema or ontology. We applied Redgraph to social network data constructed from patents, inventors, and institutions from the United States Patent and Trademark Office in order to explore networks of innovation in computing. Using this data-set, results of a user study comparing extrusion (3-D) vs. no-extrusion (2-D) are presented. The study showed the use of a 3-D interface by subjects led to significant improvement on answering of fine-grained questions about the data-set, but no significant difference was found for broad questions about the overall structure of the data.

Various relevant constructs and their measurement factors were identified to examine how desktop VR enhances learning and the fit of the hypothesized model was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results supported the indirect effect of VR features to the learning outcomes, which was mediated by the interaction experience and the learning experience. Learning experience which was individually measured by the psychological factors, that is, presence, motivation, cognitive benefits, control and active learning, and reflective thinking took central stage in affecting the learning outcomes in the desktop VR-based learning environment. The moderating effect of student characteristics such as spatial ability and learning style was also examined. The results show instructional designers and VR software developers how to improve the learning effectiveness and further strengthen their desktop VR-based learning implementation. Through this research, an initial theoretical model of the determinants of learning effectiveness in a desktop VR-based learning environment is contributed.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Computers & Education","tags":["technology-based"],"isbn":null,"id":"24cb3f10628cee74ff0603f5938294977\/wiljami74"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2023,"author_first":"Oberd\u00f6rfer, Sebastian","authors":["Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","Domna Banakou","Ayush Bhargava"],"author_count":3,"title":"Editorial: The Light and Dark Sides of Virtual Reality","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Virtual Reality","tags":["myown","dark-sides-vr"],"isbn":null,"id":"28c08869434b93f7c5909e084fb8c0d53\/oberdoerfer"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"incollection","year":1993,"author_first":"Mallen, George","authors":["George Mallen"],"author_count":1,"title":"Back to the Cave - Cultural Perspectives on Virtual Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Virtual Reality Systems","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9780122277481","id":"2ba6c99b9bf7a0c4a83f739fd1dbbbf04\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2001,"author_first":"Gilkes, Oliver J.","authors":["Oliver J.

Thirteen children aged 8-13 years comprised the study group. Children attended eight one-hour virtual reality play sessions in which they were immersed and interacted with virtual reality. The Test of Playfulness (TOP) was used as the measure to assess playfulness. Participants were videotaped while they played during 12 different environments over the course of their intervention time. Three randomly selected virtual reality play sessions were chosen to score three different virtual reality environments within each session yielding a total of nine trials (environments) for each participant. The types of virtual environments varied across participants. Overall, the different virtual reality play environments produced varying levels of playfulness according to the TOP's four different subscale scores. Motivation ranged from 1.50 to 2.25, internal control ranged from 1.00 to 1.88, suspension of reality ranged from 0 to 0.26, and framing ranged from 1.33 to 1.78. The three environments producing the highest playfulness ratings were called Paint, Trip and Island Sounds. These environments allowed creativity, persistence with the task, pleasure, and a certain degree of control. Two environments did not appear to foster playfulness. A possible reason was that these environments were too unpredictable and frustrating for participants. These results will be useful for creating new virtual reality software applications that will encourage playfulness in children with disabilities.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Occup Ther Int","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Cerebral","Male;","Therapy;","Pilot","User-Computer","Palsy;","Playthings;","Female;","Play","and","Projects;","Interface"],"isbn":null,"id":"254e86ffaebd0a457d6bcde522c87754e\/ar0berts"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2001,"author_first":"Latoschik, Marc Erich","authors":["Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":1,"title":"A Gesture Processing Framework for Multimodal Interaction in Virtual Reality","abstract":"This article presents a gesture detection and analysis framework for modelling multimodal interactions.

Typical problems that arise from the time-dependent invalidation of multimodal utterances under immersive conditions lead to the development of pre-evaluation concepts that as well support their integration into scene graph based systems to support traversal-type access. Examples of realized interactions illustrate applications which make use of the described concepts.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality and Visualisation in Africa, AFRIGRAPH 2001","journal":null,"tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"21b119525ecdcd11753bbef47bda6b963\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2014,"author_first":"Guti\u00e9rrez-Maldonado, Jos\u00e9","authors":["Jos\u00e9 Guti\u00e9rrez-Maldonado","Mar Rus-Calafell","Joan Gonz\u00e1lez-Conde"],"author_count":3,"title":"Creation of a new set of dynamic virtual reality faces for the assessment and training of facial emotion recognition ability.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2c29c224dd9f4571eaaecc40db0f4894c\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2016,"author_first":"Dimbwadyo-Terrer, Iris","authors":["Iris Dimbwadyo-Terrer","Fernando Trincado-Alonso","Ana de los Reyes-Guzm\u00e1n","Patricia L\u00f3pez-Monteagudo","Bego\u00f1a Polonio-L\u00f3pez","Alvaro L.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the fundamental distinctions between AR and VR in the context of course instruction. Educators can acquire insights into how these technologies might be effectively integrated into the classroom by evaluating their specific traits, affordances, and limits. The research begins by defining AR and VR and then compares their key ideas. AR superimposes digital information on the real-world environment to improve the user's impression of reality, whereas VR immerses users in a simulated environment to create a sensation of presence and immersion. These contrasts lay the groundwork for comprehending their disparate uses in education. The study then goes into the educational benefits and difficulties of AR and VR. AR allows students to interact with digital information in real time, encouraging engagement, collaboration, and contextualized learning. It could bridge the gap between abstract ideas and real-world applications. VR, on the other hand, provides an immersive and regulated environment that allows students to explore complicated scenarios, imitate real-world circumstances, and acquire important skills in a safe and cost-effective manner. The research looks at the technology needs, accessibility concerns, and implementation techniques for AR and VR in educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of pedagogical design, content creation, and teacher training to maximize these technologies' educational impact. This review paper investigates the differences between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in the context of course education. AR and VR have emerged as significant tools for boosting the learning experience as technology continues to alter education. Understanding the distinct characteristics and benefits of each technology is critical for educators to make educated judgments about how to include them in their teaching practices. This paper examines AR and VR in depth, concentrating on their distinctions, uses, and possible influence in educational contexts.","booktitle":null,"journal":"International Journal on Orange Technologies","tags":["Augmented","education,","Reality,","developing","Virtual","technologies,"],"isbn":null,"id":"28b5a99deec0bd1ef6cd59d9b2daff6f4\/researchpark_20"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2010,"author_first":"Latoschik, Marc Erich","authors":["Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":1,"title":"Intelligente Techniken f\u00fcr innovative Interaktionen","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Virtual Reality - Mensch und Maschine im Interaktiven Dialog","journal":null,"tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"28f9a3bcf6f34103e6158477952d2ee21\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":1993,"author_first":"Cruz-Neira, Carolina","authors":["Carolina Cruz-Neira","Daniel J.

The mechanisms and success of behavior change techniques and interventions are broadly investigated in the field of psychology. However, it is not always easy to adapt these psychological findings to the context of immersive technologies. The lack of theoretical foundation also leads to a lack of explanation as to why and how immersive interventions support behavior change processes. The Behavioral Framework for immersive Technologies (BehaveFIT) addresses this lack by 1) presenting an intelligible categorization and condensation of psychological barriers and immersive features, by 2) suggesting a mapping that shows why and how immersive technologies can help to overcome barriers and finally by 3) proposing a generic prediction path that enables a structured, theory-based approach to the development and evaluation of immersive interventions. These three steps explain how BehaveFIT can be used, and include guiding questions for each step. Further, two use cases illustrate the usage of BehaveFIT. Thus, the present paper contributes to guidance for immersive intervention design and evaluation, showing that immersive interventions support behavior change processes and explain and predict 'why' and 'how' immersive interventions can bridge the intention-behavior-gap.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers Virtual Reality","tags":["myown","rhein","rebecca.hein"],"isbn":null,"id":"2ce2d1e01010f85d2dff0850b775cc7c0\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2018,"author_first":"Monteiro, Pedro","authors":["Pedro Monteiro","Diana Carvalho","Miguel Melo","Frederico Branco","Maximino Bessa"],"author_count":5,"title":"Application of the steering law to virtual reality walking navigation interfaces.","abstract":"Navigation through immersive virtual environments is a key concept for virtual reality as it allows users to explore those environments.

This paper presents an objective performance evaluation of two types of navigation: natural (real walking and walk-in-place) vs. unnatural (gamepad). Steering Law was the objective performance metric chosen since it captures the relationship between the time to travel a path and the difficulty of that path. In addition to performance, subjective metrics were also considered, namely the feeling of presence, cybersickness and user satisfaction. The experiments consisted of having participants complete a series of paths with different indexes of difficulty and the time that a participant took to walk each path was measured. Overall results show that the navigation through real walking yielded better results when it comes to performance, cybersickness, and user satisfaction than the walk-in-place and gamepad navigation interfaces.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Computers & Graphics","tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"28aaf30af3bc9b24ce6b0a8bf02a495ff\/pmem"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2007,"author_first":"Mulder, Jurriaan D.","authors":["Jurriaan D.

This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues.

Twenty physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and prosthetic-orthotic therapists were invited to evaluate the benefits of the games through questionnaires and interviews. Eighty percents of the therapists agreed or strongly agreed that the introduction of the VR walking game could help them to care for more post-stroke patients. The first prototype used a head-mounted display (HMD) to present the VR simulation and 12 therapists reported that the quality of HMD would cause potential disorientations in elderly patients. A second prototype with three panel-mounted displays was developed and results of further evaluation confirmed that the potential benefits of VR games in clinical management of patients recovering from strokes.

Typically, gambling games try to impair a player\u2019s decision making, usually for the disadvantage of the players\u2019 financial outcome. An impaired decision making results in the inability to differentiate between advantageous and disadvantageous options. We investigated if and how immersion impacts decision making using a VR-based realization of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to pinpoint potential risks and effects of gambling in VR. During the IGT, subjects are challenged to draw cards from four different decks of which two are advantageous. The selections made serve as a measure of a participant\u2019s decision making during the task.

Design Prospective randomised controlled and blinded trial.  Setting Seven gynaecological departments in the Zeeland region of Denmark.  Participants 24 first and second year registrars specialising in gynaecology and obstetrics.  Interventions Proficiency based virtual reality simulator training in laparoscopic salpingectomy and standard clinical education (controls).  Main outcome measure The main outcome measure was technical performance assessed by two independent observers blinded to trainee and training status using a previously validated general and task specific rating scale. The secondary outcome measure was operation time in minutes.  Results The simulator trained group (n=11) reached a median total score of 33 points (interquartile range 32-36 points), equivalent to the experience gained after 20-50 laparoscopic procedures, whereas the control group (n=10) reached a median total score of 23 (22-27) points, equivalent to the experience gained from fewer than five procedures (P<0.001). The median total operation time in the simulator trained group was 12 minutes (interquartile range 10-14 minutes) and in the control group was 24 (20-29) minutes (P<0.001). The observers' inter-rater agreement was 0.79.  Conclusion Skills in laparoscopic surgery can be increased in a clinically relevant manner using proficiency based virtual reality simulator training. The performance level of novices was increased to that of intermediately experienced laparoscopists and operation time was halved.

METHOD: Sixteen children with cerebral palsy aged 8 to 12 years participated. They were observed during a variety of VR environments that were video recorded. The Pediatric Volitional Questionnaire (PVQ) was used to measure children's motivation. The PVQ provides insights into children's inner motives as well as how the virtual environment enhances or attenuates children's motives. Nine VR environments were randomly selected to score with the PVQ. RESULTS: Data were analyzed and descriptive statistics were calculated for modes and medians of total volition scores for each VR environment. Different environments produced varying levels of volitional behaviour. The features of environments that produced higher levels of volition included challenge, variability and competition. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The overall volitional scores of children with cerebral palsy in the current study indicate that VR play is a motivating activity and thus has potential as a successful intervention tool.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Can J Occup Ther","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Cerebral","Male;","Outcome;","Behavior;","User-Computer","Palsy;","Playthings;","Female;","Play","and","Child","Treatment","Motivation;","Interface"],"isbn":null,"id":"2bc66f9c820befef6749be301077ee3f8\/ar0berts"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2019,"author_first":"Kern, Florian","authors":["Florian Kern","Carla Winter","Dominik Gall","Ivo K\u00e4thner","Paul Pauli","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":6,"title":"Immersive Virtual Reality and Gamification Within Procedurally Generated Environments to Increase Motivation During Gait Rehabilitation","abstract":"Virtual Reality (VR) technology offers promising opportunities to improve traditional treadmill-based rehabilitation programs. We present an immersive VR rehabilitation system that includes a head-mounted display and motion sensors. The application is designed to promote the experience of relatedness, autonomy, and competence. The application uses procedural content generation to generate diverse landscapes. We evaluated the effect of the immersive rehabilitation system on motivation and affect. We conducted a repeated measures study with 36 healthy participants to compare the immersive program to a traditional rehabilitation program. Participants reported significant greater enjoyment, felt more competent and experienced higher decision freedom and meaningfulness in the immersive VR gait training compared to the traditional training. They experienced significantly lower physical demand, simulator sickness, and state anxiety, and felt less pressured while still perceiving a higher personal performance. We derive three design implications for future applications in gait rehabilitation: Immersive VR provides a promising augmentation for gait rehabilitation. Gamification features provide a design guideline for content creation in gait rehabilitation. Relatedness and autonomy provide critical content features in gait rehabilitation.","booktitle":"2019 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)","journal":null,"tags":["ieee2019","myown","homecoming"],"isbn":null,"id":"29c7015ff22333bc201dcded8993e2488\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2018,"author_first":"Truman, Samuel","authors":["Samuel Truman","Nicolas Rapp","Daniel Roth","Sebastian von Mammen"],"author_count":4,"title":"Rethinking real-time strategy games for virtual reality","abstract":"Recent improvements in virtual reality (VR) technology promise the opportunity to redesign established game genres, such as real-time strategy (RTS) games.

On reviewing 34 years of literature, Issenberg et al identified ten features of high-fidelity medical simulators that facilitate learning. This study compares cadaveric temporal bone (CTB) simulation with the Voxel-Man TempoSurg (VT) virtual reality simulator in addressing these features.A questionnaire was designed comparing the VT with CTB. Fourteen trainees and six consultants completed the questionnaire after using the simulator.The VT is better at allowing repetitive practice, ease of control of difficulty, and capturing clinical and pathological variation. The VT is as good as CTB in curriculum integration, allowing multiple learning strategies, providing a controlled environment, individualising learning and defining benchmarks. It appears worse with regards to face validity and feedback.Virtual reality simulation and CTB have features that allow effective learning. Some of these are common to both, in some CTB is better and in others virtual reality is better. Virtual reality could be a significant mode of learning supplementary to CTB and experience in the operating theatre.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Ann R Coll Surg Engl","tags":["voxelman","t-vr-sim"],"isbn":null,"id":"24ab3f395801a320ea7665f7ea89a6171\/stevenarild"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2021,"author_first":"Wienrich, Carolin","authors":["Carolin Wienrich","Nina Ines D\u00f6llinger","Rebecca Hein"],"author_count":3,"title":"Behavioral Framework of Immersive Technologies (BehaveFIT): How and Why Virtual Reality can Support Behavioral Change Processes","abstract":"The design and evaluation of assisting technologies to support behavior change processes have become an essential topic within the field of human-computer interaction research in general and the field of immersive intervention technologies in particular.

Hands-on patient experience - the traditional apprenticeship method for teaching operations - may not apply because of the learning curve for skill acquisition and patient safety expectation. The paranasal sinuses and temporal bone have intricate anatomy with a significant amount of vital structures either within the surgical field or in close proximity. The current standard of surgical care in these areas involves the use of endoscopes, cameras and microscopes, requiring additional hand-eye coordination, an accurate command of fine motor skills, and a thorough knowledge of the anatomy under magnified vision. A surgeon's disorientation or loss of perspective can lead to complications, often catastrophic and occasionally lethal. These considerations define the ideal environment for surgical simulation; not surprisingly, significant research and validation of simulators in these areas have occurred.Virtual reality simulators are demonstrating validity as training and skills assessment tools. Future prototypes will find application for routine use in teaching, surgical planning and the development of new instruments and computer-assisted devices.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","tags":["simulation","review"],"isbn":null,"id":"27f8c7bdf1d2774a7adc51d2b8ac942da\/stevenarild"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2022,"author_first":"D\u00f6llinger, Nina","authors":["Nina D\u00f6llinger","Erik Wolf","David Mal","Nico Erdmannsd\u00f6rfer","Mario Botsch","Marc Erich Latoschik","Carolin Wienrich"],"author_count":7,"title":"Virtual Reality for Mind and Body: Does the Sense of Embodiment Towards a Virtual Body Affect Physical Body Awareness?","abstract":"Mind-body therapies aim to improve health by combining physical and mental exercises.

One of the most accepted theories indicates that Cybersickness is caused by the visually induced impression of ego motion while physically remaining at rest. As a result of this sensory mismatch, people associate negative symptoms with VR and sometimes avoid the technology altogether. To reconcile the two contradicting sensory perceptions, we investigate GVS to stimulate the vestibular canals behind our ears with low-current electrical signals that are specifically attuned to the visually displayed camera motion. We describe how to calibrate and generate the appropriate GVS signals in real-time for pre-recorded omnidirectional videos exhibiting ego-motion in all three spatial directions. For validation, we conduct an experiment presenting real-world 360\u00b0 videos shot from a moving first-person perspective in a VR head-mounted display. Our findings indicate that GVS is able to significantly reduce discomfort for cybersickness-susceptible VR users, creating a deeper and more enjoyable immersive experience for many people.","booktitle":null,"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","tags":["myown","sysrelevantforl3s"],"isbn":null,"id":"295129dd3ebe0f8d62fa0c8cc2295370c\/tubsicg"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2020,"author_first":"Tsuyoshi, YOSHIHARA","authors":["YOSHIHARA Tsuyoshi","FUJITA Satoshi"],"author_count":2,"title":"Towards Fog-Assisted Virtual Reality MMOG with Ultra-Low Latency\r\nAuthors","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method to realize a virtual reality MMOG (Massively Multiplayer Online Video Game) with ultra-low latency. The basic idea of the proposed method is to introduce a layer consisting of several fog nodes between clients and cloud server to offload a part of the rendering task which is conducted by the cloud server in conventional cloud games. We examine three techniques to reduce the latency in such a fog-assisted cloud game: 1) To maintain the consistency of the virtual game space, collision detection of virtual objects is conducted by the cloud server in a centralized manner; 2) To reflect subtle changes of the line of sight to the 3D game view, each client is assigned to a fog node and the head motion of the player acquired through HMD (Head-Mounted Display) is directly sent to the corresponding fog node; and 3) To offload a part of the rendering task, we separate the rendering of the background view from that of the foreground view, and migrate the former to other nodes including the cloud server. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by experiments with an AWS-based prototype system. It is confirmed that the proposed techniques achieve the latency of 32.3 ms, which is 66 % faster than the conventional systems.","booktitle":null,"journal":"International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications (IJCNC)","tags":["3D","game","view","positional","computing","Cloud","of","tracking","fog","rendering"],"isbn":null,"id":"2d0cd199a842a6d7818210f099de8ab21\/laimbee"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"proceedings","year":2016,"author_first":null,"authors":null,"author_count":0,"title":"Medicine Meets Virtual Reality 22 - NextMed, MMVR 2016, Los Angeles, California, USA, April 7-9, 2016","abstract":null,"booktitle":"MMVR","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781614996255","id":"2a9e69e8d893d3a8e7037b919e499017f\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2002,"author_first":"Reid, D.

The results of four single case studies are presented. The virtual reality intervention used the Mandala Gesture Xtreme technology. It was applied to four school aged children with cerebral palsy. A pretest-posttest design was used. The relevant outcome of interest was upper extremity control as measured with the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST), item #6 of Subtest #5 of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP), and a measure of percent accuracy . The total scores on the QUEST indicated clinically significant changes in quality of upper extremity for two of the children. Changes were noted in other measures of upper extremity control for each child.Qualitative comments from the participants revealed a high degree of motivation, interest, pleasure, and opportunity for engagement in play activities not previously engaged in. Overall, this pilot study suggests the viability of a virtual reality play based intervention as part of the rehabilitation process for children with cerebral palsy. These results will form the basis of a larger scale randomized clinical trial.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Technology & Disability","tags":["print-red","skills","virtual","children","play","function","vr","pilot","cp"],"isbn":null,"id":"21722831e51bb3b6be53612053b759b7e\/willwade"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2001,"author_first":"Oehme, O.","authors":["O.

Therefore, recommendations relating to the optimal representation size of virtual information for an head mounted display with see through mode, which is used for Augmented Reality, cannot be given at the moment. In order to apply this new technology successfully to an industrial area, such information is urgently necessary. For this reason, three different kinds of displays were tested in this study regarding human information perception. Thus, the smallest target size necessary to provide successful information processing could be determined for different tasks.

The extent to which the EEG signal can be disturbed by the presence of VR sys- tems, however, has been barely investigated. This study outlines how to evaluate the compatibility of a given EEG-VR setup on the example of two commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs), the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro. We use a novel experimental protocol to compare the spectral composition between conditions with and without an HMD present during an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task. We found general artifacts at the line hum of 50 Hz, and additional HMD refresh rate artifacts (90 Hz) for the Oculus rift exclusively. Frequency components typically most interesting to non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz), however, remained largely unaffected. We observed similar topographies of visually-induced modulation of alpha band power for both HMD conditions in all subjects. Hence, the study introduces a necessary validation test for HMDs in combination with EEG and further promotes EEG as a potential biometric measurement method for psychophysical effects in VR systems.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 26th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)","journal":null,"tags":["vtimes","myown","interactive-opera"],"isbn":null,"id":"2d3a3f9715d4730f97141394d233fe880\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"incollection","year":2020,"author_first":"Orel, Marko","authors":["Marko Orel"],"author_count":1,"title":"The potentials of virtual reality in entrepreneurship education.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"New Perspectives on Virtual and Augmented Reality","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781003001874","id":"2d005f73e4ea023640682863995051fc8\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2023,"author_first":"Mal, David","authors":["David Mal","Erik Wolf","Nina D\u00f6llinger","Carolin Wienrich","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":5,"title":"The Impact of Avatar and Environment Congruence on Plausibility, Embodiment, Presence, and the Proteus Effect in Virtual Reality","abstract":"Many studies show the significance of the Proteus effect for serious virtual reality applications.

Plausibility, congruence, and their role have recently gained more and more attention. One of the latest models to describe XR experiences, the Congruence and Plausibility model (CaP), puts plausibility and congruence right in the center. However, it is unclear what influence they have on the overall XR experience and what influences our perceived plausibility rating. In this paper, we implemented four different incongruencies within a virtual reality scene using breaks in plausibility as an analogy to breaks in presence. These manipulations were either located on the cognitive or perceptual layer of the CaP model. They were also either connected to the task at hand or not. We tested these manipulations in a virtual bowling environment to see which influence they had. Our results show that manipulations connected to the task caused a lower perceived plausibility. Additionally, cognitive manipulations seem to have a larger influence than perceptual manipulations. We were able to cause a break in plausibility with one of our incongruencies. These results show a first direction on how the influence of plausibility in XR can be systematically investigated in the future.","booktitle":"2023 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)","journal":null,"tags":["myown","xrhub"],"isbn":"9798350328387","id":"2f25fea0b2ceceb6cac919ca3df189eb7\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2002,"author_first":"Suomela, Riku","authors":["Riku Suomela","Jouka Mattila","Eero R\u00e4s\u00e4nen","Timo Koskinen"],"author_count":4,"title":"Augmented Reality for a Casual User: Designing Tools for Interaction with the Virtual World.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"CGDC Conf.","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"205a8b14f9ebdfcffa0283025c1c5ac69\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2014,"author_first":"Song, Miao","authors":["Miao Song","Peter Grogono","Serguei A.

We discuss the design of the VR training. Then, we present the results of a between subject experiment (n=42) with three experimental conditions (control, training once, repeated training) investigating learning effects on subjects' negotiation skill and knowledge. In our case negotiation skill consists of negotiation outcome (final bid utility) and conversation skill (exploratory conversational choices in VR scenario), and negotiation knowledge is the subjects' quality of reflection upon filmed behavior of two negotiating actors. Our results confirm the hypothesis. We found significant effects of training on conversation skill and negotiation knowledge. We found a marginally significant effect of training on negotation outcome. As the effect of training on negotiation outcome was marginally significant and only present when controlling for overshadowing effects of the act of reflecting, we postulate that other learning approaches (e.g., instruction) are needed for trainees to use the information gained during the joint exploration phase of a negotiation for the construction of a bid. Our results are particularly important given the sparse availability of experimental studies that show learning effects of VR negotiation training, and gives additional support to those studies that do report possitive effects such as with the BiLAT system.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents","journal":null,"tags":["ACM"],"isbn":"9783642331961","id":"2831c20ed375399be43f8790d4461ab29\/alex_szykman"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2021,"author_first":"Oberd\u00f6rfer, Sebastian","authors":["Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","David Heidrich","Sandra Birnstiel","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":4,"title":"Enchanted by Your Surrounding?

The identification and separation of orthogonal presence components, i.e., the place illusion and the plausibility illusion, has been an accepted theoretical model describing Virtual Reality (VR) experiences for some time. This perspective article challenges this presence-oriented VR theory. First, we argue that a place illusion cannot be the major construct to describe the much wider scope of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR, AR, MR: or XR for short). Second, we argue that there is no plausibility illusion but merely plausibility, and we derive the place illusion caused by the congruent and plausible generation of spatial cues and similarly for all the current model\u2019s so-defined illusions. Finally, we propose congruence and plausibility to become the central essential conditions in a novel theoretical model describing XR experiences and effects.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Virtual Reality","tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"222d84056c6b550525b9693ddf6b74aba\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2021,"author_first":"Oberd\u00f6rfer, Sebastian","authors":["Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","David Heidrich","Sandra Birnstiel","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":4,"title":"Enchanted by Your Surrounding?

The possibility of precisely studying gait modulation using standardized protocols of gait analysis closely resembling everyday life scenarios is still an unmet need.Methods: We have developed a fully-immersive virtual reality (VR) environment where subjects have to adjust their walking pattern to avoid collision with a virtual agent (VA) crossing their gait trajectory. We collected kinematic data of 12 healthy young subjects walking in real world (RW) and in the VR environment, both with (VR\/A+) and without (VR\/A-) the VA perturbation. The VR environment closely resembled the RW scenario of the gait laboratory. To ensure standardization of the obstacle presentation the starting time speed and trajectory of the VA were defined using the kinematics of the participant as detected online during each walking trial.Results: We did not observe kinematic differences between walking in RW and VR\/A-, suggesting that our VR environment per se might not induce significant changes in the locomotor pattern. When facing the VA all subjects consistently reduced stride length and velocity while increasing stride duration. Trunk inclination and mediolateral trajectory deviation also facilitated avoidance of the obstacle.Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study shows that our VR\/A+ paradigm effectively induced a timely gait modulation in a standardized immersive and realistic scenario. This protocol could be a powerful research tool to study gait modulation and its derangements in relation to aging and clinical conditions.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","tags":["myown","hci-uwb"],"isbn":null,"id":"2daadcc3958520a81190fa189380f3769\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2006,"author_first":"Olaizola, Igor G.","authors":["Igor G.

The 3-D\n                 representations of m-dimensional Pareto fronts, or\n                 their approximations, are constructed via similarity\n                 structure mappings between the original objective\n                 spaces and the 3-D space. Alpha shapes are introduced\n                 for the representation and compared with previous\n                 approaches based on convex hulls. In addition, the\n                 mappings minimising a measure of the amount of\n                 dissimilarity loss are obtained via genetic\n                 programming.

Analysis of teacher\u2013child dialogue in a comparative study between use of an AR virtual mirror interface and more traditional science teaching methods for 10-year-old children, revealed that the children using AR were less engaged than those using traditional resources. We suggest four design requirements that need to be considered if AR is to be successfully adopted into classroom practice. These requirements are: flexible content that teachers can adapt to the needs of their children, guided exploration so learning opportunities can be maximised, in a limited time, and attention to the needs of institutional and curricular requirements.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["augmentedreality","mybsc"],"isbn":null,"id":"21adcb370adf69d4cc5e4e2e80e505eeb\/kw"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2022,"author_first":"Palmisano, Chiara","authors":["Chiara Palmisano","Peter Kullmann","Ibrahem Hanafi","Marta Verrecchia","Marc Erich Latoschik","Andrea Canessa","Martin Fischbach","Ioannis Ugo Isaias"],"author_count":8,"title":"A Fully-Immersive Virtual Reality Setup to Study Gait Modulation","abstract":"Objective: Gait adaptation to environmental challenges is fundamental for independent and safe community ambulation. The possibility of precisely studying gait modulation using standardized protocols of gait analysis closely resembling everyday life scenarios is still an unmet need.Methods: We have developed a fully-immersive virtual reality (VR) environment where subjects have to adjust their walking pattern to avoid collision with a virtual agent (VA) crossing their gait trajectory. We collected kinematic data of 12 healthy young subjects walking in real world (RW) and in the VR environment, both with (VR\/A+) and without (VR\/A-) the VA perturbation. The VR environment closely resembled the RW scenario of the gait laboratory. To ensure standardization of the obstacle presentation the starting time speed and trajectory of the VA were defined using the kinematics of the participant as detected online during each walking trial.Results: We did not observe kinematic differences between walking in RW and VR\/A-, suggesting that our VR environment per se might not induce significant changes in the locomotor pattern. When facing the VA all subjects consistently reduced stride length and velocity while increasing stride duration. Trunk inclination and mediolateral trajectory deviation also facilitated avoidance of the obstacle.Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study shows that our VR\/A+ paradigm effectively induced a timely gait modulation in a standardized immersive and realistic scenario. This protocol could be a powerful research tool to study gait modulation and its derangements in relation to aging and clinical conditions.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"2daadcc3958520a81190fa189380f3769\/peterkullmann"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2009,"author_first":"Bourhis, M.","authors":["M.

This method is also based on the replication of passive elements. It is a spatial distribution in which local simulations are periodically synchronized and the consistency of replicated data is checked. This synchronization is not a strong synchronization but a weak one. The consistency method is built on the transmission between nodes of the grid of the state variations of the data. The software used for distributing simulations is named DIVA, and is an individual based software located on each node of the grid. DIVA confers a peer to peer architecture upon the grid.","booktitle":"Autonomic and Autonomous Systems, 2009. ICAS '09.

Other varieties of the so-called eXtended Realities (XR), e.g., Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR and MR) incorporate immersive features to a lesser degree and continuously combine spatial cues from the real physical space and the simulated virtual space. This blurred separation questions the applicability of the accumulated knowledge about the similarities of virtual presence and presence occurring in other varieties of XR, and corresponding outcomes. The present work bridges this gap by analyzing the construct of presence in mixed realities (MR). To achieve this, the following presents (1) a short review of definitions, dimensions, and measurements of presence in VR, and (2) the state of the art views on MR. Additionally, we (3) derived a working definition of MR, extending the Milgram continuum. This definition is based on entities reaching from real to virtual manifestations at one time point. Entities possess different degrees of referential power, determining the selection of the frame of reference. Furthermore, we (4) identified three research desiderata, including research questions about the frame of reference, the corresponding dimension of transportation, and the dimension of realism in MR. Mainly the relationship between the main aspects of virtual presence of immersive VR, i.e., the place-illusion, and the plausibility-illusion, and of the referential power of MR entities are discussed regarding the concept, measures, and design of presence in MR. Finally, (5) we suggested an experimental setup to reveal the research heuristic behind experiments investigating presence in MR. The present work contributes to the theories and the meaning of and approaches to simulate and measure presence in MR. We hypothesize that research about essential underlying factors determining user experience (UX) in MR simulations and experiences is still in its infancy and hopes this article provides an encouraging starting point to tackle related questions.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Virtual Reality","tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"2bf0afb357f2b895d09e4a9d908307c33\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2019,"author_first":"Latoschik, Marc Erich","authors":["Marc Erich Latoschik","Florian Kern","Jan-Philipp Stauffert","Andrea Bartl","Mario Botsch","Jean-Luc Lugrin"],"author_count":6,"title":"Not Alone Here?!

These phenomena have been observed in both computer generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic projection systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for passive and active stereoscopic viewing and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we find that change blindness phenomena can be applied with a larger magnitude as compared to monoscopic viewing of a scene. We have also evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.","booktitle":"IEEE International Conference on Virtual Reality (VR)","journal":null,"tags":["LOCUI","objects","ChangeBlindness","virtual","stadtmodellen","virtualreality","interactive"],"isbn":null,"id":"27c955f44f58d87163c5e3d5b5a4774ba\/mcm"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"incollection","year":2020,"author_first":"Daniela, Linda","authors":["Linda Daniela","Yipaer Aierken"],"author_count":2,"title":"The educational perspective on virtual reality experiences of cultural heritage.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"New Perspectives on Virtual and Augmented Reality","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781003001874","id":"252ea6e8df2193bec18dbe624d6734447\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2019,"author_first":"Latoschik, Marc Erich","authors":["Marc Erich Latoschik","Florian Kern","Jan-Philipp Stauffert","Andrea Bartl","Mario Botsch","Jean-Luc Lugrin"],"author_count":6,"title":"Not Alone Here?!

Today, however, user evaluations of humanoid robots are often based on mediated depictions rather than actual observations or interactions with a robot, which holds true not least for scientific user studies. People can be confronted with robots in various modes of presentation, among them (1) 2D videos, (2) 3D, i.e., stereoscopic videos, (3) immersive Virtual Reality (VR), or (4) live on site. A systematic investigation into how such differential modes of presentation influence user perceptions of a robot is still lacking. Thus, the current study systematically compares the effects of different presentation modes with varying immersive potential on user evaluations of a humanoid service robot. Participants (N = 120) observed an interaction between a humanoid service robot and an actor either on 2D or 3D video, via a virtual reality headset (VR) or live. We found support for the expected effect of the presentation mode on perceived immediacy. Effects regarding the degree of human likeness that was attributed to the robot were mixed. The presentation mode had no influence on evaluations in terms of eeriness, likability, and purchase intentions. Implications for empirical research on humanoid robots and practice are discussed.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology - Human-Media Interaction","tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"20843356757802aff61b5e86bc70fd1ea\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2013,"author_first":"Ontiveros-Hern\u00e1ndez, Norma J.","authors":["Norma J.

This case study explored the use of VR analgesia with a 16-year-old patient with cerebral palsy participating in a twice-daily physiotherapy program following Single Event Multi-Level Surgery. Over 6 days, the patient spent half of his physiotherapy sessions using VR and the other half without (order randomized). Traditional pharmacological pain management was administered throughout the trial. Using a subjective pain scale (five faces denoting levels of pain), the patient's overall pain ratings whilst in the VR (experimental) condition were 41.2\\% less than those in the no-VR (control) condition. This case report provides the first evidence that VR may serve as a powerful non-pharmacologic analgesic for children following surgery.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Cyberpsychol Behav","tags":["Humans;","Postoperative","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Graphics;","Manipulations;","Measurement;","Computer-Assisted;","Analgesia;","User-Computer","Palsy;","Therapy,","Treatment","Bone","Extremity;","Simulation;","Lengthening;","Interface","Lower","Male;","Outcome;","Musculoskeletal","Pain","Pain;","Computer","Complications;","Osteotomy;"],"isbn":null,"id":"29a11c125dfb95832af3d14e169b1de2a\/ar0berts"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2003,"author_first":"Thalmann, Daniel","authors":["Daniel Thalmann","Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann"],"author_count":2,"title":"Virtual Humans for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"VR","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"0769518826","id":"274b2a531957e9a313784ba1d777a8598\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"incollection","year":2020,"author_first":"Bucher, Kristina","authors":["Kristina Bucher","Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","Silke Grafe","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":4,"title":"Von Medienbeitr\u00e4gen und Applikationen - ein interdisziplin\u00e4res Konzept zum Lehren und Lernen mit Augmented und Virtual Reality f\u00fcr die Hochschullehre","abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR) und Virtual Reality (VR) finden zunehmend Eingang in die Bildungspraxis.

The current article sketches a respective base architecture and discusses necessary research prospects and challenges as a starting point for future research and development.","booktitle":null,"journal":"i-com Journal of Interactive Media","tags":["myown","droth","insync","injectx"],"isbn":null,"id":"299e5fdfc4e906a6da7487224d809fd63\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2017,"author_first":"Latoschik, Marc Erich","authors":["Marc Erich Latoschik","Daniel Roth","Dominik Gall","Jascha Achenbach","Thomas Waltemate","Mario Botsch"],"author_count":6,"title":"The Effect of Avatar Realism in Immersive Social Virtual Realities","abstract":"This paper investigates the e ect of avatar realism on embodiment and social interactions in Virtual Reality (VR). We compared abstract avatar representations based on a wooden mannequin with high fidelity avatars generated from photogrammetry 3D scan methods. Both avatar representations were alternately applied to participating users and to the virtual counterpart in dyadic social encounters to examine the impact of avatar realism on self-embodiment and social interaction quality. Users were immersed in a virtual room via a head mounted display (HMD). Their full-body movements were tracked and mapped to respective movements of their avatars. Embodiment was induced by presenting the users\u2019 avatars to themselves in a virtual mirror. Afterwards they had to react to a non-verbal behavior of a virtual interaction partner they encountered in the virtual space. Several measures were taken to analyze the effect of the appearance of the users\u2019 avatars as well as the effect of the appearance of the others\u2019 avatars on the users. The realistic avatars were rated significantly more human-like when used as avatars for the others and evoked a stronger acceptance in terms of virtual body ownership (VBO). There also was some indication of a potential uncanny valley. Additionally, there was an indication that the appearance of the others\u2019 avatars impacts the self-perception of the users.","booktitle":"23rd ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST)","journal":null,"tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"214e5cfe00b2d73c68adcdec4f006b23f\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"book","year":2010,"author_first":"Bruder, Gerd","authors":["Gerd Bruder","Betty Mohler","Gabriel Cirio"],"author_count":3,"title":"JVRC Tutorial: Walking Experiences in Virtual Worlds","abstract":"Active exploration enables us humans to construct a rich and coherent percept of our environment. By far the most natural way to move through the real world is via locomotion like walking or running. The same should also be true for computer generated three-dimensional environments. Keeping such an active and dynamic ability to navigate through large-scale virtual scenes is of great interest for many 3D applications demanding locomotion, such as tourism, architecture or interactive entertainment. However, today it is still mostly impossible to freely walk through computer generated environments in order to actively explore them. The primary reason for this is the scientific and technological underdevelopment in this sector. While moving in the real world, sensory information such as vestibular, proprioceptive, and efferent copy signals as well as visual information create consistent multi-sensory cues that indicate one's own motion, i.e., acceleration, speed and direction of travel. Computer graphics environments were initially restricted to visual displays, combined with interaction devices, e.g. joystick or mouse, for providing (often unnatural) inputs to generate self-motion. Nowadays, more and more interaction devices, e.g., Nintendo's Wii or Sony's EyeToy, enable intuitive and natural interaction. In this context, many research groups are investigating natural, multimodal methods of generating self-motion in virtual worlds based on these consumer hardware. An obvious approach is to transfer the user's tracked head movements to changes of the camera in the virtual world by means of a one-to-one mapping. Then, a one meter movement in the real world is mapped to a one meter movement of the virtual camera in the corresponding direction in the virtual environment (VE). This technique has the drawback that the user's movements are restricted by a limited range of the tracking sensors, e.g. optical cameras, and a rather small workspace in the real world. The size of the virtual world often differs from the size of the tracked space so that a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not possible. Thus, concepts for virtual locomotion methods are needed that enable walking over large distances in the virtual world while remaining within a relatively small space in the real world. In this tutorial we will present an overview about the development of locomotion interfaces for computer generated virtual environments ranging from desktop-based camera manipulations simulating walking, and different walking metaphors for virtual reality (VR)-based environments to state-of-the-art hardware-based solutions that enable omni-directional and unlimited real walking through virtual worlds.","booktitle":null,"journal":null,"tags":["LOCUI","virtual","walking","tutorial","experiences","jvrc"],"isbn":null,"id":"2dc5f98ffcb3af1e90bcf09a8e13e0507\/mcm"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2009,"author_first":"Haouach, Mohammed","authors":["Mohammed Haouach","Gilles Venturini","Christiane Guinot"],"author_count":3,"title":"A 3D Hypermedia With Biomedical Stereoscopic Images: From Creation to Exploration in Virtual Reality","abstract":"We present in this paper a new method for building and exploring a 3D hypermedia in virtual reality and for a biomedical domain. Starting from the acquisition of stereoscopic images and from the calibration of cameras, our system offers the user the possibility to visualize these images in 3D and to annotate specific areas with texts or voice recording. Then the user may define links between annotations, and each annotation may point to annotations from the same image or from other images. The user thus constructs a 3D hypermedia. He may have a global view of the images database using a graph display. We present a first graph which was built with images of faces.","booktitle":"HT '09: Proceedings of the Twentieth ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia","journal":null,"tags":["ht2009","image","annotation","exploration","virtual","visualization","reality","pp138","interactive","images","graph","stereoscopic","of","poster"],"isbn":null,"id":"21250550f13f78fe812822bb4f9a4da99\/ht09"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2019,"author_first":"Gl\u00e9marec, Yann","authors":["Yann Gl\u00e9marec","Anne-Gwenn Bosser","Jean-Luc Lugrin","Mathieu Chollet","C\u00e9dric Buche","Maximilian Landeck","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":7,"title":"A Scalability Benchmark for a Virtual Audience\r\nPerception Model in Virtual Reality","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Proceedings of the 25th ACM Conference on Virtual Reality Software and Technology","journal":null,"tags":["myown","vraudi","vrst19"],"isbn":null,"id":"22322d5ad5fa3d4acca3a4baaa8ee36b5\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2019,"author_first":"Lugrin, Jean-Luc","authors":["Jean-Luc Lugrin","Andreas Juchno","Philipp Schaper","Maximilian Landeck","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":5,"title":"Drone-Steering: A Novel VR Traveling Technique","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Proceedings of the 25th ACM Conference on Virtual Reality Software and Technology","journal":null,"tags":["schaper","myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"24dcfc690205073794eda27ccd569fa2a\/sia-bib"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2007,"author_first":"Ye, Jilin","authors":["Jilin Ye","Saurin Badiyani","Vinesh Raja","Thomas Schlegel"],"author_count":4,"title":"Applications of Virtual Reality in Product Design Evaluation.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"HCI (4)","journal":null,"tags":["productdesign","virtualreality"],"isbn":"9783540731092","id":"2e6354025df6949a604741ce23752004b\/enitsirhc"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2006,"author_first":"Pan, Zhigeng","authors":["Zhigeng Pan","Adrian David Cheok","Hongwei Yang","Jiejie Zhu","Jiaoying Shi"],"author_count":5,"title":"Virtual reality and mixed reality for virtual learning environments.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Comput.

We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.","booktitle":null,"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"22af6590de4950cf45fd1d898e0825a94\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"proceedings","year":2017,"author_first":null,"authors":null,"author_count":0,"title":"IEEE 10th Workshop on Software Engineering and Architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems (SEARIS)","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":null,"tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"2908ceae20e079084a0b480dedc64e299\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"proceedings","year":2013,"author_first":null,"authors":null,"author_count":0,"title":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Software Engineering and Architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems (SEARIS)","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":null,"tags":["AR","SEARIS","myown","realtime","software","workshop","engineering","interactive","VR","architectures"],"isbn":null,"id":"2880ace5d388ad45e6d1331a61b0f71fa\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2007,"author_first":"Qureshi, Faisal Z.","authors":["Faisal Z.

One approach currently attracting attention is the application of adaptive tile-based streaming solutions to the VR video arena. The VR videos are encoded at different quality levels, temporally divided into segments and spatially split into tiles. During the streaming, each of these tiles can be transmitted independently according to its location within the frame (i.e., within or outside of the user's field of view). These methods open a new venue for bandwidth and latency optimization for the streaming of VR videos. However, the effect of the different adaptive streaming optimizations on the end-user perception is still an open research topic. In this demo, we present a VR video platform to experience the working principles of adaptive tile-based VR video streaming services. Through different tiling approaches, bandwidth conditions and viewport algorithms, it allows the users to explore the effects that each optimization has on the perception of the service. In addition, the platform provides real-time bandwidth savings and objective Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements to provide a quantitative analysis of the optimizations effects. This demo aims to provide a common playground for researchers to benchmark, and evaluate the performance of their optimization solutions.","booktitle":"30th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC 30)","journal":null,"tags":["itc","itc30","Session_3.2:_Madness_Session"],"isbn":null,"id":"29995492bc245b659d94fa26b72ce3385\/itc"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2018,"author_first":"G\u00e4ckle, Kristian","authors":["Kristian G\u00e4ckle","Tim Reichert","Nicola Marsden"],"author_count":3,"title":"Virtual reality or virtuous reality?: how gender stereotypes limit access to virtual reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"GenderIT","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781450335966","id":"28a235c24570fd2ef2728b69aa1c162c2\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2002,"author_first":"Bridges, Douglas S.","authors":["Douglas S.

EFs are important cognitive functions for athletes. They are a relevant quality that distinguishes amateurs from professionals.\r\nMethod: The system is based on immersive technology, hence, the user interacts naturally and experiences a training session in a virtual world. The proposed system has a modular design supporting the extension of various so-called game modes. Game modes combine selected game mechanics with specific simulation content to target particular training aspects. The system architecture decouples selection\/parameterization and analysis of training sessions via a coaching app from an Unity3D-based VR simulation core. Monitoring of user performance and progress is recorded by a database that sends the necessary feedback to the coaching app for analysis. Results: The system is tested for VR-critical performance criteria to reveal the usefulness of a new interaction paradigm in the cognitive training and analysis of EFs. Subjective ratings for overall usability show that the design as VR application enhances the user experience compared to a traditional desktop app; whereas the new, unfamiliar interaction paradigm does not negatively impact the effort for using the application.\r\nConclusion: The system can provide immersive training of EF in a fully virtual environment, eliminating potential distraction. It further provides an easy-to-use analyzes tool to compare user but also an automatic, adaptive training mode.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","tags":["myown","own"],"isbn":null,"id":"22a36783babfac9f5810c38c53b4d7812\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2021,"author_first":"Kern, Florian","authors":["Florian Kern","Peter Kullmann","Elisabeth Ganal","Kristof Korwisi","Rene Stingl","Florian Niebling","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":7,"title":"Off-The-Shelf Stylus: Using XR Devices for Handwriting and Sketching on Physically Aligned Virtual Surfaces","abstract":"This article introduces the Off-The-Shelf Stylus (OTSS), a framework for 2D interaction (in 3D) as well as for handwriting and sketching with digital pen, ink, and paper on physically aligned virtual surfaces in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR: XR for short).

After VR therapy, the altered activations disappeared and the contralateral SMC was activated. This neuroplastic change was associated with enhanced functional motor skills including reaching, self-feeding, and dressing. These functions were not possible before the intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study in the literature that provides evidence for neuroplasticity after VR therapy in a child with hemiparetic CP.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Dev Med Child Neurol","tags":["Activities","Humans;","Plasticity;","Hemiplegia;","Motor","Cerebral","Living;","Dominance,","Feedback;","Skills;","Neuronal","(Health","Cortex;","Cerebral;","Enhancement;","User-Computer","Palsy;","Outcome","Lobe;","Somatosensory","Resonance","Parietal","Interface","Performance;","Child;","Encephalomalacia;","Care);","Assessment","Male;","Psychomotor","Practice","Process","Image","(Psychology);","Oxygen;","Daily","Magnetic","of","Temporal","and","Imaging;"],"isbn":null,"id":"2f95a89dc5ecb9679476f26daf1351646\/ar0berts"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"incollection","year":2019,"author_first":"Pietroszek, Krzysztof","authors":["Krzysztof Pietroszek"],"author_count":1,"title":"Virtual Hand Metaphor in Virtual Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Encyclopedia of Computer Graphics and Games","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2be4a955843ffb99a3ae542f0da8da81b\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2019,"author_first":"Howie, Scott Ronald","authors":["Scott Ronald Howie","Marco Gilardi"],"author_count":2,"title":"Virtual Observation of Virtual Reality Simulations.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"CHI Extended Abstracts","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781450359719","id":"2b79f5caf9984b76d2710c1536f81033b\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2007,"author_first":"Korn, Matthias","authors":["Matthias Korn","Maik Stange","Andreas von Arb","Lisa Blum","Michael Kreil","Kathrin-Jennifer Kunze","Jens Anhenn","Timo Wallrath","Thorsten Grosch"],"author_count":9,"title":"Interactive Augmentation of Live Images using a HDR Stereo Camera","abstract":"Adding virtual objects to real environments plays an important role in todays computer graphics: Typical examples are virtual furniture in a real room and virtual characters in real movies. For a believable appearance, consistent lighting of the virtual objects is required. We present an augmented reality system that displays virtual objects with consistent illumination and shadows in the image of a simple webcam. We use two high dynamic range video cameras with fisheye lenses permanently recording the environment illumination. A sampling algorithm selects a few bright parts in one of the wide angle images and the corresponding points in the second camera image. The 3D position can then be calculated using epipolar geometry. Finally, the selected point lights are used in a multipass algorithm to draw the virtual object with shadows. To validate our approach, we compare the appearance and shadows of the synthetic objects with real objects.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Journal of Virtual Reality and Broadcasting","tags":["Interactive_Augmentation","4(2007)12","DiPP","4.2007","Open_Access","Journal_of_Virtual_Reality_and_Broadcasting","Stereo_Camera","HDR","Peer_Reviewed","JVRB","[KSvA07]","Digital_Peer_Publishing_Initiative","Digital_Peer_Publishing_License"],"isbn":null,"id":"2829ab153fd34ee2ef0a41fab88392acb\/jvrb_regulski"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2006,"author_first":"Seibert, Helmut","authors":["Helmut Seibert","Patrick D\u00e4hne"],"author_count":2,"title":"System Architecture of a Mixed Reality Framework","abstract":"In this paper the software architecture of a framework which simplifies the development of applications in the area of Virtual and Augmented Reality is presented.

However, very little objective evidence is available yet on the matter. This study was conducted to identify factors that influence surgeons' performance, as measured by a virtual reality computer simulator for laparoscopic surgery.This study included 25 surgical residents who had limited experience with laparoscopic surgery, having performed fewer than 10 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The participants were registered according to their gender, hand dominance, and experience with computer games. All of the participants performed 10 repetitions of the six tasks on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) within 1 month. Assessment of laparoscopic skills was based on three parameters measured by the simulator: time, errors, and economy of hand movement.Differences in performance existed between the compared groups. Men completed the tasks in less time than women ( p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test), but there was no statistical difference between the genders in the number of errors and unnecessary movements. Individuals with right hand dominance performed fewer unnecessary movements ( p = 0.045, Mann-Whitney test), and there was a trend toward better results in terms of time and errors among the residence with right hand dominance than among those with left dominance. Users of computer games made fewer errors than nonusers ( p = 0.035, Mann-Whitney test).The study provides objective evidence of a difference in laparoscopic skills between surgeons differing gender, hand dominance, and computer experience. These results may influence the future development of training program for laparoscopic surgery. They also pose a challenge to individuals responsible for the selection and training of the residents.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Surg Endosc","tags":["generalsurgery"],"isbn":null,"id":"2ff0f615f59d58421f9046369e32a8e1a\/stevenarild"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2009,"author_first":"Stone, Robert J.","authors":["Robert J.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted at the Imperial College Virtual Reality Surgical Skills laboratory amongst 25 trainees and nine senior gynaecologists. Participants performed two sessions of salpingectomy and salpingotomy procedures on a VR simulator to assess construct validity. Nine novices performed ten such sessions to enable assessment of the learning curve. The relationship between cognitive load and the dexterity parameters was assessed. Simulator fidelity was reported by experienced and intermediate level gynaecologists. Statistical analyses utilised non-parametric tests, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Learning curves were assessed using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Relationship between dexterity metrics and cognitive load was performed using Spearman's rank order correlation. RESULTS: Salpingectomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken by experienced, intermediate and novice gynaecologists (median 170 vs. 191 vs. 313s (P=0.003) respectively) and movements (median 200 vs. 267 vs. 376s, P=0.045). Salpingotomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken (median 183 vs. 191 vs. 306s, P=<0.001) and movements (median 210 vs. 233 vs. 328s, P=0.005). Learning curve analysis for salpingectomy displayed a plateau for time taken after the eighth session, and the fourth session for movements. Salpingotomy displayed a plateau after the eighth session for both time taken and movements. Cognitive load correlated significantly with dexterity parameters. The fidelity scores were not significantly different between the two procedures (P=0.619). CONCLUSION: The LAP Mentor VR laparoscopic simulator is a valid and effective tool for training novice surgeons in ectopic pregnancy surgery. Reduction in cognitive load significantly correlates with the learning curves.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol","tags":["cognitiveload"],"isbn":null,"id":"27e906f6f14d70df7f714ee4f40a99572\/stevenarild"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2018,"author_first":"Wu, Pei","authors":["Pei Wu","Ping An","Jian Ma"],"author_count":3,"title":"Quality Assessment of Virtual Reality Videos.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"IFTC","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9789811381386","id":"23d7df9695368bfcffbb8257f786b7fc1\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2022,"author_first":"D\u00f6llinger, Nina","authors":["Nina D\u00f6llinger","Erik Wolf","David Mal","Stephan Wenninger","Mario Botsch","Marc Erich Latoschik","Carolin Wienrich"],"author_count":7,"title":"Resize Me!

In this study, we go a step further, showing that a variety of private user information can be inferred just by analyzing motion data recorded from VR devices. We conducted a large-scale survey of VR users (N=1,006) with dozens of questions ranging from background and demographics to behavioral patterns and health information. We then obtained VR motion samples of each user playing the game \"Beat Saber,\" and attempted to infer their survey responses using just their head and hand motion patterns. Using simple machine learning models, over 40 personal attributes could be accurately and consistently inferred from VR motion data alone. Despite this significant observed leakage, there remains limited awareness of the privacy implications of VR motion data, highlighting the pressing need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in multi-user VR applications.","booktitle":null,"journal":null,"tags":["myown","prima","schell"],"isbn":null,"id":"2e47037e16c8819f262c5d01d3b30dd9c\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"phdthesis","year":2007,"author_first":"Chan, Melanie A.","authors":["Melanie A.

Children with spastic CP completed ankle selective motor control exercises using a virtual reality (VR) exercise system and conventional (Conv) exercises. Ankle movements were recorded with an electrogoniometer. Children and their parents were asked to comment on their interest in the exercise programs.

Children completed more repetitions of the Conv exercises, but the range of motion and hold time in the stretched position were greater during VR exercises.

We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systems\u00e2\u20ac\u0090related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics.\r\nIn previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This work\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 mshop provides a face\u00e2\u20ac\u0090to\u00e2\u20ac\u0090face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems RIS. Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as real\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepa\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current state\u00e2\u20ac\u0090of\u00e2\u20ac\u0090the\u00e2\u20ac\u0090art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sum\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 omarize the work our community is doing.\r\n\r\nArranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop's goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections:\r\n\r\n* Systems. Six development systems are presented InTml, Lightning, FlowVR, OpenMASK VISTA, and MORGAN \r\n* Abstraction Is \u00e2\u20ac\u0090 sues. Two papers address the issues of reusable VE platforms and alterna tives to scene graphs. \r\n* Special Issues. In this section we collect papers related to the implementation of RIS in particular platforms, such as mobile systems, multi\u00e2\u20ac\u0090rate systems, and Mixed Reality. \r\n* Semantic and Dynamic Modeling. The four papers in this section show models for expli\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 citly describing semantic (i.e. \u00e4 chair is on the floor\") and dynamic information.\r\n* Semantic and Dynamic Modeling.

Multimodal and Unimodal Interaction for Open Creative Design Tasks in Virtual Reality","abstract":"Multimodal Interfaces (MMIs) have been considered to provide promising interaction paradigms for Virtual Reality (VR) for some time. However, they are still far less common than unimodal interfaces (UMIs). This paper presents a summative user study comparing an MMI to a typical UMI for a design task in VR. We developed an application targeting creative 3D object manipulations, i.e., creating 3D objects and modifying typical object properties such as color or size. The associated open user task is based on the Torrence Tests of Creative Thinking. We compared a synergistic multimodal interface using speech-accompanied pointing\/grabbing gestures with a more typical unimodal interface using a hierarchical radial menu to trigger actions on selected objects. Independent judges rated the creativity of the resulting products using the Consensual Assessment Technique. Additionally, we measured the creativity-promoting factors flow, usability, and presence. Our results show that the MMI performs on par with the UMI in all measurements despite its limited flexibility and reliability. These promising results demonstrate the technological maturity of MMIs and their potential to extend traditional interaction techniques in VR efficiently.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction","journal":null,"tags":["ewolf","myown","mmi"],"isbn":"9781450375818","id":"2ab2b3b8d5d6a6c5e05f3483f0f3e934f\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2019,"author_first":"Elmqaddem, Noureddine","authors":["Noureddine Elmqaddem"],"author_count":1,"title":"Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in Education.

We also found no significant difference in time perception between the real and the VR conditions (avatar, no-avatar), but further research is needed to better understand this outcome.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Virtual Reality","tags":["vtimes","myown","hci-uwb"],"isbn":null,"id":"2262ee8256ba07acc08dee56a5d11cf81\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":1990,"author_first":"Blanchard, Chuck","authors":["Chuck Blanchard","Scott Burgess","Young Harvill","Jaron Lanier","Ann Lasko","Mark Oberman","Mike Teitel"],"author_count":7,"title":"Reality built for two: a virtual reality tool.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"I3D","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"0897913515","id":"213ab52367cfc1c96958a9173b75153ba\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2018,"author_first":"Rau, Pei-Luen Patrick","authors":["Pei-Luen Patrick Rau","Jian Zheng","Zhi Guo","Jiaqi Li"],"author_count":4,"title":"Speed reading on virtual reality and augmented reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Comput.

Simulator X is targeted at Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and computer games. It provides a foundation and testbed for a variety of different application models. The current research architecture is based on the actor model to support fine grained concurrency and parallelism. Its design follows the minimize coupling and maximize cohesion software engineering principle. A distributed world state and execution scheme is combined with an object-centered world view based on an entity model. Entities conceptually aggregate properties internally represented by state variables. An asynchronous event mechanism allows intra- and interprocess communication between the simulation actors. An extensible world interface uses an ontology-based semantic annotation layer to provide a coherent world view of the resulting distributed world state and execution scheme to application developers. The world interface greatly simplifies configurability and the semantic layer provides a solid foundation for the integration of different Artificial Intelligence components. The current architecture is implemented in Scala using the Java virtual machine. This choice additionally fosters low-level scalability, portability, and reusability.","booktitle":"2011 IEEE Virtual Reality Conference","journal":null,"tags":["myown","simx"],"isbn":null,"id":"2045fe3ce1f6035d8428c768a267070ab\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2017,"author_first":"Pop, Mihai","authors":["Mihai Pop","Adrian Sabou"],"author_count":2,"title":"Gesture-based Visual Analytics in Virtual Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"RoCHI","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"27248030ffe603cae3ee2f517f94d0f4f\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2017,"author_first":"Balazinska, Magdalena","authors":["Magdalena Balazinska","Luis Ceze","Alvin Cheung","Brian Curless","Steven M.

We have developed a number of spatial interaction techniques that optically capture the device\u2032s movement and orientation relative to a visual marker. Such physical interactions in 3D space enable manipulative control of mobile games. In addition to acting as a physical controller that recognizes multiple game-dependent gestures, the mobile device augments the camera view with graphical overlays. We describe three game prototypes that use ubiquitous product packaging and other passive media as backgrounds for handheld augmentation. The prototypes can be realized on widely available off-the-shelf hardware and require only minimal setup and infrastructure support.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Journal of Virtual Reality and Broadcasting","tags":["Tracking","Handheld_Devices","DiPP","Embodied_User_Interfaces","4.2007","4(2007)5","Visual_Markers","Open_Access","PerGames2006","Journal_of_Virtual_Reality_and_Broadcasting","Mobile_Devices","AR","Augmented_Reality","Visual_Codes","[Roh07]","Peer_Reviewed","Portable_Device","JVRB","Interaction_Techniques","Cell_Phone","Digital_Peer_Publishing_Initiative","Camera_Phones","Pervasive_Gaming"],"isbn":null,"id":"2715737a9c8d1d65a7b2ffbcfbd6a9798\/jvrb_regulski"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"book","year":2020,"author_first":null,"authors":null,"author_count":0,"title":"New Perspectives on Virtual and Augmented Reality - Finding New Ways to Teach in a Transformed Learning Environment","abstract":null,"booktitle":"New Perspectives on Virtual and Augmented Reality","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781003001874","id":"2af7dabf57a0f0b966f3d66ef5fc674f5\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"article","year":2006,"author_first":"Kealy, William A.","authors":["William A.

The rehabilitation of gait disorders in multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke patients is often based on conventional treadmill training. Virtual reality (VR)-based treadmill training can increase motivation and improve therapy outcomes.\r\nObjective. The present study aimed at (1) demonstrating the feasibility and acceptance of an immersive virtual reality application (presented via head-mounted display, HMD) for gait rehabilitation with patients, and (2) compare its effects to a semi-immersive presentation (via a monitor) and a conventional treadmill training without VR. \r\nMethods and results.  36 healthy participants and 14 persons with MS or stroke participated in each of the three experimental conditions. For both groups, the walking speed in the HMD condition was higher than in treadmill training without VR. Healthy participants reported a higher motivation after the HMD condition as compared with the other conditions. Importantly, no side effects in the sense of simulator sickness occurred and usability ratings were high. Most of the healthy study participants (89 %) and patients (71 %) preferred the HMD-based training among the three conditions and most patients could imagine using it more frequently.\r\nConclusion. The study demonstrated the feasibility of combining a treadmill training with immersive VR. Due to its high usability and low side effects, the immersive system could serve as a valid alternative to conventional treadmill training in gait rehabilitation. It might be particularly suited for patients to improve training motivation and training outcome e. g. the walking speed compared with treadmill training using no or only semi-immersive VR.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation","tags":["myown","homecoming"],"isbn":null,"id":"268cd9fc7ed80f06c978941c4e154168f\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2001,"author_first":"Born, Rainer P.","authors":["Rainer P.

VR systems allow for highly controlled experimental environments, while EEG offers a non-invasive window to brain activity with a millisecond-ranged temporal resolution. However, EEG measurements are highly susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in healthy subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artifacts, especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of 90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected. Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings, at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary devices.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","tags":["myown","hci-uwb"],"isbn":null,"id":"21e7a807ba9bd032986f71e3b07810d12\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"incollection","year":2010,"author_first":"Deines, Eduard","authors":["Eduard Deines","Martin Hering-Bertram","Jan Mohring","Jevgenijs Jegorovs","Hans Hagen"],"author_count":5,"title":"Audio-visual Virtual Reality System for Room Acoustics.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Scientific Visualization: Advanced Concepts","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9783939897194","id":"27bc4edce2d3c8eb7e753d4c144484fed\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2004,"author_first":"Pressigout, Muriel","authors":["Muriel Pressigout","\u00c9ric Marchand"],"author_count":2,"title":"Model-Free Augmented Reality by Virtual Visual Servoing.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"ICPR (2)","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"0769521282","id":"2c71e38826654379cfbf5ba87294e0780\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2019,"author_first":"Nebeling, Michael","authors":["Michael Nebeling","Katy Madier"],"author_count":2,"title":"360proto: Making Interactive Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality Prototypes from Paper.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"CHI","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781450359702","id":"2d1c601627ac264eabeeed254c97d3bf9\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2020,"author_first":"Li, Liping","authors":["Liping Li","Xiaosong Wu"],"author_count":2,"title":"Application of virtual reality and augmented reality technology in Teaching1.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"ICCSE","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781728172675","id":"246909dc75e46724c7347c1ccc7818cf8\/dblp"},{"search_string":"vr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2018,"author_first":"Waycott, Jenny","authors":["Jenny Waycott","Greg Wadley","Steven Baker","Hasan Shahid Ferdous","Thuong N.

Ray tracing techniques process pixels independently from each other, allowing an easy integration with image-based tracking techniques, contrary to traditional projection-based rasterization graphics systems, e.g. OpenGL. Therefore, by associating our highly optimized ray tracer with an augmented reality framework, the proposed pipeline is capable to provide high quality rendering with real time interaction between virtual and real objects, such as occlusions, soft shadows, custom shaders, reflections and self-reflections, some of these features only available in our rendering pipeline. As proof of concept, we present a case study with the ARToolKitPlus library and the Microsoft Kinect hardware, both integrated in our pipeline. Furthermore, we show the performance and visual results in high definition of the novel pipeline on modern graphics cards, presenting occlusion and recursive reflection effects between virtual and real objects without the latter ones needing to be previously modeled when using Kinect. Furthermore, an adaptive soft shadow sampling algorithm for ray tracing is presented, generating high quality shadows in real time for most scenes.","booktitle":"Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR), 2012 14th Symposium on","journal":null,"tags":["augmented_reality","real-time","reflection"],"isbn":null,"id":"2e24c3575bfaf9eacae21517b37c8026e\/ledood"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2020,"author_first":"V, R.

Augmented reality allows interaction with virtual objects spatially registered in the user\u2019s real environment, in order to provide information, facilitate collaboration and control machines. As the comput- ing and interaction devices necessary for augmented reality become ubiquitously available, opportunities arise for improved interaction and new applications.\r\nBuilding ubiquitous augmented reality systems presents three software engineering chal- lenges. First, the system must cope with uncertainty regarding the software components; the users\u2019 mobility changes the availability of distributed devices. Second, during development, the system\u2019s desired behavior is ill-defined, as appropriate interaction metaphors are still be- ing researched and users\u2019 preferences change. Third, the system must maintain near-real-time performance to create a convincing user experience.\r\nThis dissertation presents a new architectural style, the adaptive service dependency architec- ture, to address these challenges.\r\nThe architecture deals with component uncertainty, using middleware for decentralized ser- vice management to dynamically adapt the system\u2019s structure. It builds on existing architec- tural approaches, such as loosely coupled services, service discovery, reflection, and data flow architectures, but additionally considers the interdependencies between distributed services and uses them for system adaption.\r\nWith the development technique of design at run time, users and developers address ill- defined requirements by changing the system\u2019s behavior while it is running, facilitating the creation of new applications. This is based on existing agile development methods, but takes additional advantage of the architecture\u2019s adaptive and reflective properties.\r\nDistributed middleware maintains the required performance by decoupling multimedia data flow from system reconfiguration. It combines existing communication and service discovery technologies, but additionally deals with the distributed coordination of networks of interde- pendent services.\r\nSeveral prototype systems for real-world ubiquitous augmented reality applications have been built using the adaptive service dependency architecture, decentralized middleware, and design at run time.

Augmented reality (AR) neuronavigation is a significant advance, providing a real-time updated 3D virtual model of anatomical details, overlaid on the real surgical field. Currently, only a few AR systems have been tested in a clinical setting. The aim is to review such devices. We performed a PubMed search of reports restricted to human studies of in vivo applications of AR in any neurosurgical procedure using the search terms ``Augmented reality'' and ``Neurosurgery.'' Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers in an unblinded standardized manner. The systems were qualitatively evaluated on the basis of the following: neurosurgical subspecialty of application, pathology of treated lesions and lesion locations, real data source, virtual data source, tracking modality, registration technique, visualization processing, display type, and perception location. Eighteen studies were included during the period 1996 to September 30, 2015. The AR systems were grouped by the real data source: microscope (8), hand- or head-held cameras (4), direct patient view (2), endoscope (1), and X-ray fluoroscopy (1) head-mounted display (1).

This is especially important for our application context, which utilizes mobile AR for navigation and other operations in an urban environment. A key problem in the AR field is how to best depict occluded objects in such a way that the viewer can correctly infer the depth relationships between different physical and virtual objects. Showing a single occluded object with no depth context presents an ambiguous picture to the user. But showing all occluded objects in the environments leads to the \u201cSuperman\u2019s X-ray vision \u201d problem, in which the user sees too much information to make sense of the depth relationships of objects. Our efforts differ qualitatively from previous work in AR occlusion, because our application domain involves farfield occluded objects, which are tens of meters distant from the user. Previous work has focused on near-field occluded objects, which are within or just beyond arm\u2019s reach, and which use different perceptual cues. We designed and evaluated a number of sets of display attributes. We then conducted a user study to determine which representations best express occlusion relationships among far-field objects. We identify a drawing style and opacity settings that enable the user to accurately interpret three layers of occluded objects, even in the absence of perspective constraints. 1","booktitle":"In ISMAR &apos;03","journal":null,"tags":["layers","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"isbn":null,"id":"2c18abc8a5704dcf1c8cb52789674c316\/kw"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2013,"author_first":"Seichter, Hartmut","authors":["Hartmut Seichter","Jens Grubert","Tobias Langlotz"],"author_count":3,"title":"Designing mobile augmented reality","abstract":"The development of mobile Augmented Reality application became increasingly popular over the last few years.

Charakteristisch f\u00fcr Augmented Reality (AR) ist die Anreicherung des Sichtfeldes des Betrachters mit rechnergenerierten virtuellen Objekten, um damit Produkt oder Prozessinformationen situationsgerecht im Kontext zur wahrgenommenen Realit\u00e4t intuitiv nutzbar zu machen. Diese innovative Art der Mensch-Technik-Interaktion erfordert neben der anwendungsorientierten Entwicklung der AR-Basistechnologien insbesondere die Ber\u00fccksichtigung von Benutzeranforderungen bei der ergonomischen Gestaltung von AR-Systemen. Die Projektideen wurden in f\u00fcr die deutsche Industrie relevanten Anwendungsfeldern wie Automobil- und Flugzeugbau, Maschinen- und Anlagenbau realisiert. Eine besondere Perspektive war damit f\u00fcr mittelst\u00e4ndische Unternehmen verbunden, die durch verbesserte Diagnose- und Wartungskompetenz flexibler und effizienter agieren k\u00f6nnen und damit eine St\u00e4rkung im globalen Wettbewerb erfahren. Konkret erfolgte im Rahmen von ARVIKA die Konzentration bei der Entwicklung auf das Automobil, bei der Produktion auf das Automobil und Flugzeug und beim Service auf die Kraftwerksanlagentechnik sowie Werkzeug- und Produktionsmaschinen. Dadurch wurden wesentliche industrielle Einsatzf\u00e4lle von AR abgedeckt und die notwendige anwendungsorientierte Tiefe zur Verifikation dieser neuartigen Technik erreicht. Diese inhaltlichen Schwerpunkte waren in einen Prozess der benutzerzentrierten Systemgestaltung eingebettet, die das Projekt in allen Phasen begleitet und sich auf arbeitswissenschaftliche Methoden st\u00fctzt. Durch die Einbeziehung potentieller zuk\u00fcnftiger Benutzer wurde sichergestellt, dass die entwickelten AR-Systeme den Anforderungen von Mitarbeitern, Arbeitsprozessen und M\u00e4rkten entsprechen, die Benutzungsschnittstellen ergonomisch gestaltet wurden und Verbesserungen der Arbeitsorganisation bei den Projektpartnern durch AR-Funktionalit\u00e4ten in den prototypischen Umsetzungen nachgewiesen werden konnten und somit auch ein Beleg der wirtschaftlichen Effekte stattfand.","booktitle":"Benutzerzentrierte Gestaltung von Augmented-Reality-Systemen","journal":null,"tags":["Augmented_Reality","Ergonomie","Benutzerschnittstelle","Interaktion","Virtuelle_Realit\u00e4t","ARVIKA","mmspub"],"isbn":null,"id":"23fd7e249e1d213da3f795bf2631bbaa0\/sdt"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2014,"author_first":"Tanuwidjaja, Enrico","authors":["Enrico Tanuwidjaja","Derek Huynh","Kirsten Koa","Calvin Nguyen","Churen Shao","Patrick Torbett","Colleen Emmenegger","Nadir Weibel"],"author_count":8,"title":"Chroma: A Wearable Augmented-reality Solution for Color Blindness","abstract":"Color blindness is a highly prevalent vision impairment that inhibits people's ability to understand colors. Although classified as a mild disability, color blindness has important effects on the daily activity of people, preventing them from performing their tasks in the most natural and effective ways. In order to address this issue we developed Chroma, a wearable augmented-reality system based on Google Glass that allows users to see a filtered image of the current scene in real-time. Chroma automatically adapts the scene-view based on the type of color blindness, and features dedicated algorithms for color saliency. Based on interviews with 23 people with color blindness we implemented four modes to help colorblind individuals distinguish colors they usually can't see. Although Glass still has important limitations, initial tests of Chroma in the lab show that colorblind individuals using Chroma can improve their color recognition in a variety of real-world activities. The deployment of Chroma on a wearable augmented-reality device makes it an effective digital aid with the potential to augment everyday activities, effectively providing access to different color dimensions for colorblind people.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing","journal":null,"tags":["augmented-reality,","color","blindness,","wearables","glass,"],"isbn":"9781450329682","id":"298bb9b0340fb1a25859d27dac113012e\/weibel"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2002,"author_first":"Furmanski, Chris","authors":["Chris Furmanski","Ronald Azuma","Mike Daily"],"author_count":3,"title":"Augmented-reality visualizations guided by cognition: Perceptual heuristics for combining visible and obscured information","abstract":"One of the unique applications of Mixed and Augmented Reality (MR\/AR) systems is that hidden and occluded objects can be readily visualized.

Augmented reality (AR) neuronavigation is a significant advance, providing a real-time updated 3D virtual model of anatomical details, overlaid on the real surgical field. Currently, only a few AR systems have been tested in a clinical setting. The aim is to review such devices. We performed a PubMed search of reports restricted to human studies of in vivo applications of AR in any neurosurgical procedure using the search terms ``Augmented reality'' and ``Neurosurgery.'' Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers in an unblinded standardized manner. The systems were qualitatively evaluated on the basis of the following: neurosurgical subspecialty of application, pathology of treated lesions and lesion locations, real data source, virtual data source, tracking modality, registration technique, visualization processing, display type, and perception location. Eighteen studies were included during the period 1996 to September 30, 2015. The AR systems were grouped by the real data source: microscope (8), hand- or head-held cameras (4), direct patient view (2), endoscope (1), and X-ray fluoroscopy (1) head-mounted display (1). A total of 195 lesions were treated: 75 (38.46\u00a0\\%) were neoplastic, 77 (39.48\u00a0\\%) neurovascular, and 1 (0.51\u00a0\\%) hydrocephalus, and 42 (21.53\u00a0\\%) were undetermined. Current literature confirms that AR is a reliable and versatile tool when performing minimally invasive approaches in a wide range of neurosurgical diseases, although prospective randomized studies are not yet available and technical improvements are needed.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Neurosurgical Review","tags":["reality","mixed","surgery"],"isbn":null,"id":"29d0c28b6dd450c4e7573da301b359a6d\/jofo"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2006,"author_first":"Bimber, Oliver","authors":["Oliver Bimber","Ramesh Raskar"],"author_count":2,"title":"Modern approaches to augmented reality","abstract":null,"booktitle":"SIGGRAPH '06: ACM SIGGRAPH 2006 Courses","journal":null,"tags":["raskar","realtime","virtual-reality","siggraph","course","camera-projector-systems","augmented-reality","da","bimber"],"isbn":"1595933646","id":"2433c7d9ba1e7705315ad68cf0b6c8cce\/rwoz"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"misc","year":2001,"author_first":"Azuma, Ronald","authors":["Ronald Azuma","Yohan Baillot","Steven Feiner"],"author_count":3,"title":"Recent Advances in Augmented Reality","abstract":"AR&#039;s growth and prog reg have be1 re1T kable In the late 1990s,se e ral confenffi62 onARbe09I including the Inte national Workshop and Symposium onAugmeI e Re6I93 , the Inte national Symposiumon Mixe Re9797 , and the DeTE30fiz Augme2 e Re0939 Environmez9 workshop.Some we719Ifiz9T organizations forme that focuse on AR, notably the Mixe Re06 ity Systefi Lab in Japan and the Arvika consortium in Ge many.

While it is easy to line up annotations with a target point&#039;s projection in the view plane, finding the correct distance for the annotation is difficult if the target point is not represented in an environment model. We have found that AR depth cues, such as vertical and horizontal shadow planes, a small top-down map, or color encodings of relative depth, have a positive impact on a user&#039;s ability to align a 3D cursor with physical objects at various distances. These cues aid the user&#039;s depth perception and estimation by providing information about the 3D cursor&#039;s distance and its relationship in 3-space to any features that may already have been annotated. We conducted a user study that measures the effects of different depth cues for both absolute 3D cursor placement as well as placement relative to a small number of marked reference points, whose distances are known. Our study provides insight about mobile AR users &#039; ability to judge distances both absolutely and relatively, and we identify techniques that successfully enhance their performance. 1.","booktitle":"In Wearable Computers, 2005.

For example, some objects may have geometric properties that are determined entirely by a physical simulation and which cannot be modified, while other objects may be annotations whose position and size are flexible. We introduce algorithms that use upright rectangular extents to represent on the view plane a dynamic and efficient approximation of the occupied space containing the projections of visible portions of 3D objects, as well as the unoccupied space in which objects can be placed to","booktitle":null,"journal":null,"tags":["mybsccandid","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"isbn":null,"id":"2a05cff37bd7e7c402762ef4a8599c9f8\/kw"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2001,"author_first":"Friedrich, W.","authors":["W.

However, existing AR systems like MARS 1 or Tinmith 2, which require a user to wear a notebook computer in a backpack and a head-mounted display (HMD) are expensive, fragile and inconvenient to wear. Thin-client approaches using a Tablet PC or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) merely as a portable display 34 require a dedicated server infrastructure and limit mobility. We believe there is a need for an unconstrained, infrastructureindependent AR display running to fill the gap in situations where traditional backpack systems are too costly and cumbersome, but thin client implementations exhibit inadequate deployability, scalability or interactive behavior. Particular examples include sporadic use over lengthy time spans, in between which devices must be stowed away, mixed indoor\/outdoor use in wide-area environments, and massively multi-user application scenarios.

Using the realtime camera image as a guide, the user overlays a 3D form of the food. Additionally the user selects the food type. The corresponding nutrition information is automatically computed. Thus accurate volume estimation is required for accurate nutrition information assessment. This work presents an evaluation of our mobile augmented reality approaches for portion estimation and offers a comparison to conventional portion estimation approaches. The comparison is performed on the basis of a user study (n=28). The quality of nutrition assessment is measured based on the error in energy units. In the results of the evaluation one of our mobile augmented reality approaches significantly outperforms all other methods.

The prototypes can be realized on widely available off-the-shelf hardware and require only minimal setup and infrastructure support.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Journal of Virtual Reality and Broadcasting","tags":["Tracking","Handheld_Devices","DiPP","Embodied_User_Interfaces","4.2007","4(2007)5","Visual_Markers","Open_Access","PerGames2006","Journal_of_Virtual_Reality_and_Broadcasting","Mobile_Devices","AR","Augmented_Reality","Visual_Codes","[Roh07]","Peer_Reviewed","Portable_Device","JVRB","Interaction_Techniques","Cell_Phone","Digital_Peer_Publishing_Initiative","Camera_Phones","Pervasive_Gaming"],"isbn":null,"id":"2715737a9c8d1d65a7b2ffbcfbd6a9798\/jvrb_regulski"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2015,"author_first":"Rodr\u00edguez-Calatayud, Nuria","authors":["Nuria Rodr\u00edguez-Calatayud","Jordi Linares-Pellicer","David Heras-Evangelio"],"author_count":3,"title":"An Augmented Reality Application for Art Exhibitions.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"ERCIM News","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2c3dfd8a0aa90ad171571e2380a91f33d\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2014,"author_first":"Razafimahazo, Mathieu","authors":["Mathieu Razafimahazo","Nabil Laya\u00efda","Pierre Genev\u00e8s","Thibaud Michel"],"author_count":4,"title":"Mobile Augmented Reality Applications for Smart Cities.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"ERCIM News","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"24e7f1057751630611b80bc7ac51aa409\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2011,"author_first":"Carmigniani, Julie","authors":["Julie Carmigniani","Borko Furht"],"author_count":2,"title":"Augmented Reality: An Overview.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Handbook of Augmented Reality","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781461400639","id":"20cde69362147b676dcc93b393651268f\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2011,"author_first":"D\u00fcnser, Andreas","authors":["Andreas D\u00fcnser","Mark Billinghurst"],"author_count":2,"title":"Evaluating Augmented Reality Systems.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Handbook of Augmented Reality","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781461400639","id":"2da1a16251d1007c91097aeea528242b1\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2014,"author_first":"Gwilt, Ian","authors":["Ian Gwilt"],"author_count":1,"title":"Augmented Reality Graffiti and Street Art.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Augmented Reality Art","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9783319062037","id":"2afff18b9fa751366d6a0a44e3a878e63\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2014,"author_first":"Vincs, Kim","authors":["Kim Vincs","Alison Bennett","John McCormick","Jordan Beth Vincent","Stephanie Hutchison"],"author_count":5,"title":"Skin to Skin: Performing Augmented Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Augmented Reality Art","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9783319062037","id":"2510f0a5afd9bf78e1411dff215c30a0d\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2011,"author_first":"Lizandra, M.

The system design is based on a distributed shared scene graph that alleviates the application programmer from explicitly considering distribution, and avoids a separation of graphical and application data. The idea of unifying all system data in the scene graph is taken to its logical consequence by implementing application instances as nodes in the scene graph. Through the distributed shared scene graph mechanism, consistency of scene graph replicas and the contained application nodes is assured. Multi-user 3D widgets allow concurrent interaction with minimal coordination effort from the application.

This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues.

Therefore, we apply Augmented Reality technology for developing a city tour web site to collect the opinions of users. Therefore, the website stickiness is an important measurement. The major tasks of the work include the exploration of Augmented Reality technology and the evaluation of the outputs of Augmented Reality. The feedback opinions of users are valuable references for improving AR application in the work. As a result, the AR increasing the visual and interactive effects of web page encourages users to stay longer and more than 80\\% of users are willing to return for visiting the website soon. Moreover, several valuable conclusions about Augmented Reality technology in web user interface design are also provided for further practical references.","booktitle":null,"journal":"International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications(IJACSA)","tags":["Google","SketchUp","Augmented","Visual","User","Reality;","Represeantion;","Design;","Interface"],"isbn":null,"id":"29e809bf14ab1297297a005ccc8dabf29\/thesaiorg"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2010,"author_first":"Pustka, D","authors":["D Pustka","M Huber","C Waechter","F Echtler","P Keitler","J Newman","D Schmalstieg","G Klinker"],"author_count":8,"title":"Ubitrack: Automatic Configuration of Pervasive Sensor Networks for Augmented Reality","abstract":"The range of most Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality systems is usually constrained to laboratories by the limited range of a single expensive 6DOF tracking system. Our Ubiquitous Tracking (Ubitrack) approach seeks to overcome this limitation, not by extending the range of a single tracker, but by dynamically incorporating a number of heterogeneous sensors. The Ubitrack tool set consists of Spatial Relationship Graphs (SRGs), which allow for a formal specification of tracking environments, and Spatial Relationship Patterns, which are used to derive data flow configurations by systematic analysis of the SRG. This formal framework supports a distributed software architecture, where clients efficiently produce, transform, transmit and consume tracking data, coordinated by a Ubitrack server. In this document, we discuss both theoretical and implementational aspects and illustrate the new possibilities on a scenario, where a mobile AR user is guided through a building using a diverse and changing set of sensors.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Pervasive Computing, IEEE","tags":["sensornetworks","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"isbn":null,"id":"29488005919638c07773f6b13a6e26ed8\/kw"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2017,"author_first":"Klose, E.

Researchers have solved many technical challenges during that time, finally allowing practical access to this user interface. While early AR research focused on head-mounted displays and backpack computers, it now encompasses a variety of enabling technologies, including camera phones and other handhelds, advanced projector-camera systems, and AR-extended professional devices, such as x-ray scanners. It is this evolution that has finally made it possible to use AR in our daily lives. Although AR's practical applications have not yet reached the level that many people involved in the field have dreamed of, the number of these applications is steadily increasing. Beyond what has been published about AR in the scientific literature and the lay press, current research in the field poses some exciting questions: What's real about augmented reality? What role does it play for all of us today, and what impact will it potentially have on society in the future? Will there be a killer app for AR, or will the AR bubble finally burst? Currently, the areas in which AR seems to do very well include entertainment, education, advertising\/marketing, and medicine.

Based on this finding, approaches to support the therapy of body perception disturbances in eating or body weight disorders by mixed reality (MR) systems gain in importance. However, the methodological heterogeneity of previous research has made it difficult to assess the suitability of different MR systems for therapeutic use in these areas. The effects of MR system properties and related psychometric factors on body-related perceptions have so far remained unclear. We developed an interactive virtual mirror embodiment application to investigate the differences between an augmented reality see-through head-mounted-display (HMD) and a virtual reality HMD on the before-mentioned factors. Additionally, we considered the influence of the participant's body-mass-index (BMI) and the BMI difference between participants and their avatars on the estimations. The 54 normal-weight female participants significantly underestimated the weight of their photorealistic, generic avatar in both conditions. Body weight estimations were significantly predicted by the participants' BMI and the BMI difference. We also observed partially significant differences in presence and tendencies for differences in virtual body ownership between the systems. Our results offer new insights into the relationships of body weight perception in different MR environments and provide new perspectives for the development of therapeutic applications.","booktitle":"2020 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)","journal":null,"tags":["myown","vitras"],"isbn":null,"id":"2bada42d64e2397fe6a57364756b2f3f4\/n.doellinger"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2022,"author_first":"Wolf, Erik","authors":["Erik Wolf","David Mal","Viktor Frohnapfel","Nina D\u00f6llinger","Stephan Wenninger","Mario Botsch","Marc Erich Latoschik","Carolin Wienrich"],"author_count":8,"title":"Plausibility and Perception of Personalized Virtual Humans between Virtual and Augmented Reality","abstract":"This article investigates the effects of different XR displays on the\r\nperception and plausibility of personalized virtual humans. We compared immersive virtual reality (VR), video see-through augmented reality (VST AR), and optical see-through AR (OST AR). The personalized virtual alter egos were generated by state-of-the-art photogrammetry methods. 42 participants were repeatedly exposed to animated versions of their 3D-reconstructed virtual alter egos in each of the three XR display conditions. The reconstructed virtual alter egos were additionally modified in body weight for each repetition. We show that the display types lead to different degrees of incongruence between the renderings of the virtual humans and the presentation of the respective environmental backgrounds, leading to significant effects of perceived mismatches as part of a plausibility measurement. The device-related effects were further partly confirmed by subjective misestimations of the modified body weight and the measured spatial presence. Here, the exceedingly incongruent OST AR condition leads to the significantly highest weight misestimations as well as to the lowest perceived spatial presence. However, similar effects could not be confirmed for the affective appraisal (i.e., humanness, eeriness, or attractiveness) of the virtual humans, giving rise to the assumption that these factors might be unrelated to each other.","booktitle":"2022 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)","journal":null,"tags":["ewolf","myown","emlab","vitras","dmal"],"isbn":null,"id":"2712d04b52d6b79c2a53ff43a898905f0\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2020,"author_first":"Wolf, Erik","authors":["Erik Wolf","Nina D\u00f6llinger","David Mal","Carolin Wienrich","Mario Botsch","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":6,"title":"Body Weight Perception of Females using Photorealistic Avatars in Virtual and Augmented Reality","abstract":"The appearance of avatars can potentially alter changes in their users' perception and behavior. Based on this finding, approaches to support the therapy of body perception disturbances in eating or body weight disorders by mixed reality (MR) systems gain in importance. However, the methodological heterogeneity of previous research has made it difficult to assess the suitability of different MR systems for therapeutic use in these areas. The effects of MR system properties and related psychometric factors on body-related perceptions have so far remained unclear. We developed an interactive virtual mirror embodiment application to investigate the differences between an augmented reality see-through head-mounted-display (HMD) and a virtual reality HMD on the before-mentioned factors. Additionally, we considered the influence of the participant's body-mass-index (BMI) and the BMI difference between participants and their avatars on the estimations. The 54 normal-weight female participants significantly underestimated the weight of their photorealistic, generic avatar in both conditions. Body weight estimations were significantly predicted by the participants' BMI and the BMI difference. We also observed partially significant differences in presence and tendencies for differences in virtual body ownership between the systems. Our results offer new insights into the relationships of body weight perception in different MR environments and provide new perspectives for the development of therapeutic applications.","booktitle":"2020 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)","journal":null,"tags":["ewolf","myown","emlab","vitras","dmal"],"isbn":null,"id":"2bada42d64e2397fe6a57364756b2f3f4\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2002,"author_first":"Marchand, E.","authors":["E.

Science education needs to prepare students for a future world in which multiple representations are the norm and adults are required to  think like scientists.  Location-based augmented reality games offer an opportunity to create a  post-progressive  pedagogy in which students are not only immersed in authentic scientific inquiry, but also required to perform in adult scientific discourses. This cross-case comparison as a component of a design-based research study investigates three cases (roughly 28 students total) where an Augmented Reality curriculum, Mad City Mystery, was used to support learning in environmental science. We investigate whether augmented reality games on handhelds can be used to engage students in scientific thinking (particularly argumentation), how game structures affect students\u2019 thinking, the impact of role playing on learning, and the role of the physical environment in shaping learning. We argue that such games hold potential for engaging students in meaningful scientific argumentation. Through game play, players are required to develop narrative accounts of scientific phenomena, a process that requires them to develop and argue scientific explanations. We argue that specific game features scaffold this thinking process, creating supports for student thinking non-existent in most inquiry-based learning environments.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Journal of Science Education and Technology","tags":["mybsccandid","games","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"isbn":null,"id":"2d179f74ea64a5e31ac466217050fe528\/kw"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2016,"author_first":"Aschenbrenner, Doris","authors":["Doris Aschenbrenner","Nicolas Maltry","Johannes Kimmel","Michael Albert","Julian Scharnagl","Klaus Schilling"],"author_count":6,"title":"ARTab - using Virtual and Augmented Reality Methods for an improved Situation Awareness for Telemaintenance","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Proceedings of the 4th IFAC Symposium on Telematics Applications","journal":null,"tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"2e649173c413e94217b26f543d1e3e7e6\/uniwue_cs7"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2018,"author_first":"Borrmann, D.","authors":["D.

Therefore, these point clouds have to be transformed into representations that fulfill the computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In this tutorial participants will be introduced to state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing and surface reconstruction with open source software to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by interleaved presentations, software demonstrations and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in C\/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes and other meshing methods will play another central role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering, segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface reconstruction will be provided.

The addition of haptic (force and\/or tactile) feedback has been proposed as a way to further enhance the performance of these systems. However, due to limitations in sensing and control technologies, implementing direct haptic feedback to the surgeon's hands remains impractical for clinical application. A new, intuitive augmented reality system for presentation of force information through sensory substitution has been developed and evaluated. The augmented reality system consists of force-sensing robotic instruments, a kinematic tool tracker, and a graphic display that overlays a visual representation of force levels on top of the moving instrument tips. The system is integrated with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) and tested by several users in a phantom knot tying task. The augmented reality system decreases the number of broken sutures, decreases the number of loose knots, and results in more consistent application of forces.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc","tags":["imported"],"isbn":null,"id":"24a8e665afb1fa28fccdee718f649b365\/barabas"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2017,"author_first":"Tamisier, Thomas","authors":["Thomas Tamisier","Irene M.

In addition, two other kinds of assembly support media (a paper manual and a tutorial by an expert) were examined in order to compare them with ARsembly. The results showed that the assembly times varied according to the different support conditions. AR-support proved to be more suitable for difficult tasks than the paper manual, whereas for easier tasks, the use of a paper manual did not differ significantly from AR-support.

We evaluate whether the Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality head-mounted display, causes simulator sickness and how different symptom groups contribute to it (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation).

The purpose of this research is to investigate the fundamental distinctions between AR and VR in the context of course instruction. Educators can acquire insights into how these technologies might be effectively integrated into the classroom by evaluating their specific traits, affordances, and limits. The research begins by defining AR and VR and then compares their key ideas. AR superimposes digital information on the real-world environment to improve the user's impression of reality, whereas VR immerses users in a simulated environment to create a sensation of presence and immersion. These contrasts lay the groundwork for comprehending their disparate uses in education. The study then goes into the educational benefits and difficulties of AR and VR. AR allows students to interact with digital information in real time, encouraging engagement, collaboration, and contextualized learning. It could bridge the gap between abstract ideas and real-world applications. VR, on the other hand, provides an immersive and regulated environment that allows students to explore complicated scenarios, imitate real-world circumstances, and acquire important skills in a safe and cost-effective manner. The research looks at the technology needs, accessibility concerns, and implementation techniques for AR and VR in educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of pedagogical design, content creation, and teacher training to maximize these technologies' educational impact. This review paper investigates the differences between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in the context of course education. AR and VR have emerged as significant tools for boosting the learning experience as technology continues to alter education. Understanding the distinct characteristics and benefits of each technology is critical for educators to make educated judgments about how to include them in their teaching practices. This paper examines AR and VR in depth, concentrating on their distinctions, uses, and possible influence in educational contexts.","booktitle":null,"journal":"International Journal on Orange Technologies","tags":["Augmented","education,","Reality,","developing","Virtual","technologies,"],"isbn":null,"id":"28b5a99deec0bd1ef6cd59d9b2daff6f4\/researchpark_20"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2011,"author_first":"Liao, Hongen","authors":["Hongen Liao"],"author_count":1,"title":"3D Medical Imaging and Augmented Reality for Image-Guided Surgery.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Handbook of Augmented Reality","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781461400639","id":"2e5a3f3f4b387f704c3e19066842ab65b\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2000,"author_first":"Mackay, Wendy E.","authors":["Wendy E.

These synthetic receptors offer complimentary information on our surroundings and endow us with novel means of manipulating physical or even virtual objects. We realize highly compliant magnetosensitive skins with directional perception that enable magnetic cognition, body position tracking, and touchless object manipulation. Transfer printing of eight high-performance spin valve sensors arranged into two Wheatstone bridges onto 1.7-\u03bcm-thick polyimide foils ensures mechanical imperceptibility. This resembles a new class of interactive devices extracting information from the surroundings through magnetic tags. We demonstrate this concept in augmented reality systems with virtual knob-turning functions and the operation of virtual dialing pads, based on the interaction with magnetic fields. This technology will enable a cornucopia of applications from navigation, motion tracking in robotics, regenerative medicine, and sports and gaming to interaction in supplemented reality.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Science Advances","tags":["ar","article"],"isbn":null,"id":"28dfc6c172ea20564d9dcf01c9460259b\/gaipel"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2018,"author_first":"Klose, E.

Analysis of teacher\u2013child dialogue in a comparative study between use of an AR virtual mirror interface and more traditional science teaching methods for 10-year-old children, revealed that the children using AR were less engaged than those using traditional resources. We suggest four design requirements that need to be considered if AR is to be successfully adopted into classroom practice. These requirements are: flexible content that teachers can adapt to the needs of their children, guided exploration so learning opportunities can be maximised, in a limited time, and attention to the needs of institutional and curricular requirements.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Virtual Reality","tags":["augmentedreality","mybsc"],"isbn":null,"id":"21adcb370adf69d4cc5e4e2e80e505eeb\/kw"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2012,"author_first":"Dey, Arindam","authors":["Arindam Dey","Graeme Jarvis","Christian Sandor","Gerhard Reitmayr"],"author_count":4,"title":"Tablet Versus Phone: Depth Perception in Handheld Augmented Reality","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR)","journal":null,"tags":["Handheld_Displays","Visualization","Estimation","User_Evaluation","Augmented_Reality","X-ray_Visualization","Mobile_handsets","Cameras","Depth_Perception","Mobile_communication","Outdoor_Environment","Target_tracking"],"isbn":"9781467346603","id":"2caa81047e3816c5ae7cbca85291274bd\/felixl7"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2014,"author_first":"Irshad, Shafaq","authors":["Shafaq Irshad","Dayang Rohaya Bt Awang Rambli"],"author_count":2,"title":"User Experience of Mobile Augmented Eeality: A Review of Studies","abstract":"Augmented Reality is an advance technology that enhances the real world by overlaying digital data on top of it.

Indeed, a review of currently available mobile AR apps suggests that they are embracing practical uses instead of simply showing off the capabilities of AR. Many of these apps are making information more ubiquitous without making the user necessarily aware of the data's origins, using graphics to represent multiple datasets. There has been however little research focusing on the trends in AR and the types of data visualisations used in mobile AR. The purpose of this paper is to fill that void by presenting an analysis of currently popular mobile AR apps on the market. Our findings from this small-scale investigation give an indication of the types of visualisation styles used in current mobile AR apps and highlight suggestions for how to make the information presented more relevant, for example by using better filtering methods.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction","journal":null,"tags":["tablet","trend"],"isbn":"9781450327657","id":"2a6062772f790b84c1d73e46f7c2335b3\/gon"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2019,"author_first":"Manno-Kovacs, Andrea","authors":["Andrea Manno-Kovacs","Csaba Benedek","Levente Kov\u00e1cs"],"author_count":3,"title":"Content-Based Analysis of Medical Image Data for Augmented Reality Based Health Applications.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"ERCIM News","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2dcba184a218908f861274ba65f1d3ff0\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2002,"author_first":"Oehme, O.","authors":["O.

The system allows shapes that carry contextual meanings for humans to be used as Augmented Reality (AR) tracking targets. The user can teach the system new shapes in real time. New shapes can be shown to the system frontally, or they can be automatically rectified according to previously learned shapes. Shapes can be automatically assigned virtual content by classification according to a shape class library. Nestor performs shape recognition by analyzing contour structures and generating projective-invariant signatures from their concavities. The concavities are further used to extract features for pose estimation and tracking. Pose refinement is carried out by minimizing the reprojection error between sample points on each image contour and its library counterpart. Sample points are matched by evolving an active contour in real time. Our experiments show that the system provides stable and accurate registration, and runs at interactive frame rates on a Nokia N95 mobile phone.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on","tags":["AR","estimation","pose","for","mobile"],"isbn":null,"id":"2a3ea7eec41c8741ec4b8124edce7bca1\/rohitg"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2002,"author_first":"Suomela, Riku","authors":["Riku Suomela","Jouka Mattila","Eero R\u00e4s\u00e4nen","Timo Koskinen"],"author_count":4,"title":"Augmented Reality for a Casual User: Designing Tools for Interaction with the Virtual World.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"CGDC Conf.","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"205a8b14f9ebdfcffa0283025c1c5ac69\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2007,"author_first":"Squire, Kurt D.","authors":["Kurt D.

In our study, participants were immersed in a simulated cooking environment using an AR-HMD, where they had to fulfill customer orders. During the cooking process, participants received notifications related to customer orders and ingredient updates. They were given three interaction modes for those notifications: voice commands, eye gaze and dwell, and hand gestures.

However, recycling also is a complex process, as each type of waste needs a specific recycling method. This comes along with multiple recycling containers, each relevant for one specific type of waste. Ensuring a correct recycling process therefore not only requires specific infrastructure, but also a respective attitude and knowledge of the population. Stressing the need for an accessible educational opportunity addressing waste separation, we present a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application that guides a user through a recycling process and hence scaffolds the learning of proper recycling of each type of waste. The app further provides a prototypical implementation of a product scanner, that identifies the waste type based on a marker and assists the recycling on a case-by-case decision. Using self-determination theory as a framework, we integrated gamification elements, aiming for enhanced need satisfaction, motivation and user experience. In a user study, we compared the gamified version to a control version, with both app versions yielding a high acceptance, user experience, and waste separation behavior. This indicates the importance of providing easy-to-use mobile apps allowing for a learning and assistance of proper recycling.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Mobile Human-Computer Interaction (MobileHCI '22)","journal":null,"tags":["oberdoerfer","myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"26ac0ae6af1fcfdface2f4d2167676106\/oberdoerfer"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2006,"author_first":null,"authors":null,"author_count":0,"title":"Augmented Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Encyclopedia of Multimedia","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9780387243955","id":"22c3f70751812248976781e35669a8f54\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2008,"author_first":null,"authors":null,"author_count":0,"title":"Augmented Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Encyclopedia of Multimedia","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9780387784144","id":"2b093d6dafb60997e152758ad6e3fcee7\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2017,"author_first":"Hilgert, Felix","authors":["Felix Hilgert"],"author_count":1,"title":"Augmented Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Comput. und Recht","tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"2f760b7ad78746474508018b7fa64edc1\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":1993,"author_first":"Woodwark, John R.","authors":["John R.

The three tasks are a visual stimulus-response task (VSRT), a simple walking task and a walking obstacle course. Also, we investigate the effects of different AR text positions on primary task and reading performance as well as subjective preference. We propose a novel out of sight body-locked text placement for AR text presentation to be used in dual-task situations and compare it to head-locked text placement, each in two heights. AR reading affected performance in all tasks and reading speed was affected in all dual-task conditions. Participants subjectively preferred the body-locked text presentation, while objective measures do not reflect that preference. Differences between the tasks and several interaction effects between task and AR text placement demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the context of use when designing AR reading UIs. The presented study with 12 participants provides insights into the effects of AR glasses usage in dual-task situations and several design recommendations are derived from the results.","booktitle":"26th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (Osaka 2019)","journal":null,"tags":["itegpub","mmspub"],"isbn":null,"id":"2cb5fe503fd65c44615c29265d7dc82d1\/sdt"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2020,"author_first":"Sermet, Yusuf","authors":["Yusuf Sermet","Ibrahim Demir"],"author_count":2,"title":"Virtual and augmented reality applications for environmental science education and training.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"New Perspectives on Virtual and Augmented Reality","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781003001874","id":"2fffe33ecf1dced2ccdb833ba9d455de6\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2021,"author_first":"Jishtu, Pearl","authors":["Pearl Jishtu","Madhura A Yadav"],"author_count":2,"title":"FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY IN ARCHITECTURE & PLANNING - AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY: AN OVERVIEW","abstract":"Speed has become a way of life.

To integrate AR in the everyday classroom, teachers need to be capable of designing their own immersive experiences for their students, which is why an analysis of existing authoring toolkits is necessary to identify suitable tools for educational application development and future research directions in terms of educational AR. We identified \u201ceasy access\u201d, \u201cGUI-based design\u201d, and \u201cinteractive contents\u201d as needs of teachers for designing AR content for the classroom. Based on these needs, we conducted a literature review of 835 documents. Of 80 relevant articles, we included 43 peer-reviewed articles from ACM Digital Library, DBLP, IEEExplore, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and miscellaneous other sources in our analysis. We identified 69 different AR authoring toolkits and classified these with regard to their accessibility, their degree of required programming knowledge, and their interactivity. The results show a divergent research landscape with a lack of empirical evaluation. Of 26 openly accessible toolkits, we identified five toolkits addressing the defined needs of teachers for designing interactive AR experiences for the classroom without requiring extensive programming knowledge. We conclude that there are only few tools for the straightforward design of educational AR experiences addressing the needs of teachers and suggest using research-informed and evidence-based criteria for developing AR authoring toolkits for education.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Virtual Reality","tags":["grafe"],"isbn":null,"id":"2b3910f9325d803089bf93ed1eca0ff9a\/sp-jmu"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2012,"author_first":"Olsson, Thomas","authors":["Thomas Olsson","Tuula K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen","Else Lagerstam","Leena Vent\u00e4-Olkkonen"],"author_count":4,"title":"User evaluation of mobile augmented reality scenarios.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"JAISE","tags":["augmentedReality","userStudies","example"],"isbn":null,"id":"2a3bc70b5ffe4283222dc509279822e45\/jenniferhaefner"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2016,"author_first":"Santos, Marc Ericson","authors":["Marc Ericson Santos","Igor Souza Almeida","Goshiro Yamamoto","Takafumi Taketomi","Christian Sandor","Hirokazu Kato"],"author_count":6,"title":"Exploring Legibility of Augmented Reality X-ray","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Multimedia Tools Appl.","tags":["Augmented_reality_X-ray","Empirical_study","Visualization","Augmented_reality","Legibility"],"isbn":null,"id":"2a2dbf3f862022eee7a2edd3a5dc94fd9\/felixl7"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"incollection","year":2020,"author_first":"Bucher, Kristina","authors":["Kristina Bucher","Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","Silke Grafe","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":4,"title":"Von Medienbeitr\u00e4gen und Applikationen - ein interdisziplin\u00e4res Konzept zum Lehren und Lernen mit Augmented und Virtual Reality f\u00fcr die Hochschullehre","abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR) und Virtual Reality (VR) finden zunehmend Eingang in die Bildungspraxis.

In such contexts, it is particularly important to display information without obscuring essential areas of central vision. Information can, thus, be presented to the peripheral vision. The objective of the present study was to investigate how peripheral visual cues should be displayed in AR to achieve efficient perception during walking. We conducted a pilot study and tested three different versions of directional cues presented while walking or standing still: simply popping up, moving towards the indicated direction, or changing color. The results indicated that the perception of peripheral cues in AR is generally less efficient while walking than standing still. Within the walking condition, the color-changing cue was perceived best.","booktitle":"Arbeit HUMAINE gestalten: 67.

Technically, the system is based on a video see-through head-mounted display that allows for embedding the real hand into a virtual scene and to visually manipulate its position in 3D. Two novel methods are introduced on top of this basis: an intuitive virtual object touching paradigm and a hand-displacement-based active pseudo-haptics technique. Both approaches are studied with respect to their benefits, limitations, effects on the behaviour of the user and consequences for the design of Virtual Environments. It is demonstrated that new forms of human-computer interaction are possible exploiting the described visuomotor conflicts of the hand.

In the study, an international sample of 1988 primary school students and 91 teachers used an AR-enhanced gamified STEM learning app (intervention group) or traditional teaching and learning approaches (control group). Student motivation and performance were assessed in a pre and post test design and teachers\u2019 opinions were recorded using online surveys. The results indicate that students and teachers in the intervention group considered the motivational impact of the AR-enhanced gamified app significantly higher, compared to the ratings for alternative media in the control group. The product-moment correlation between motivation and further variables, such as student attitudes and self-efficacy, showed significant, medium strong results which are comparably high in intervention and control group. Only in the intervention group, motivation and learning achievement were correlated. Students and teachers in the intervention group tended to agree on the motivational impact of the study phase while a correlation between the opinions of teachers and students in the control group could not be confirmed. Overall, the study provides evidence of the pedagogical usefulness of AR-enhanced gamified STEM learning applications in terms of supporting student motivation, based on findings from a large international sample.","booktitle":"2023 IEEE Games, Entertainment, Media Conference (GEM)","journal":null,"tags":["Tiede","Grafe","ARETE"],"isbn":null,"id":"2820e0fbbfad17e1894ba93e9751b588d\/sp-jmu"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2021,"author_first":"Tiede, Jennifer","authors":["Jennifer Tiede","Eleni Mangina","Silke Grafe"],"author_count":3,"title":"Evaluation Design Methodology for Piloting Two Educational Augmented Reality STEM Apps in European Elementary Schools","abstract":"According to research findings, Augmented Reality (AR) can have a positive impact on student STEM learning and knowledge acquisition.

Teachers are central stakeholders in the educational use of AR; given their daily classroom practice, they are also experts in the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of respective innovative educational technologies. Yet, few studies systematically analysed teachers\u2019 opinions and experiences about the advantages and problems in the educational use of AR technologies so far. In response to this desideratum, the following paper presents results from a systematic and category-based qualitative content analysis based on an interview study. The input was collected from a heterogeneous and international convenience sample of n=11 teachers after they had piloted one out of three AR-enhanced learning apps in their daily classroom practice. The results confirm that increased student motivation and classroom engagement and advanced learning achievements are considered the predominant advantages and that issues with software and technology were perceived as the biggest problems in the pilot study. Furthermore, dimensions of motivation and classroom engagement are considered in detail to achieve an in-depth analysis and to bring forward important recommendations for further developments and for teachers\u2019 future educational use of AR technologies.","booktitle":"Proceedings of 17th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED 2023)","journal":null,"tags":["Tiede","F\u00f6rster","Grafe","ARETE"],"isbn":null,"id":"22c1731ae326623237c0f2bbf1bfb1e5a\/sp-jmu"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2008,"author_first":"Schmalstieg, Dieter","authors":["Dieter Schmalstieg","Tobias Langlotz","Mark Billinghurst"],"author_count":3,"title":"Augmented Reality 2.0.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Virtual Realities","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9783211991770","id":"28015b79cca80ed595891664e96dd29d4\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2011,"author_first":"Wither, Jason","authors":["Jason Wither","Yun-Ta Tsai","Ronald Azuma"],"author_count":3,"title":"Indirect augmented reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Comput.

Indeed, everyday walking in complex environments utilizes executive function, dual tasking, planning and scanning, all while walking forward. Pilot studies suggest that a multi-modal intervention that combines treadmill training to target motor function and a virtual reality obstacle course to address the cognitive components of fall risk may be used to successfully address the motor-cognitive interactions that are fundamental for fall risk reduction. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on fall risk.","booktitle":null,"journal":"BMC Neurology","tags":["read","excluded","vr","scholar"],"isbn":null,"id":"2a7d145f2605a93394762faf42b7aecd3\/thegreatemu"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2019,"author_first":"Sz\u00fccs, L\u00e1szl\u00f3","authors":["L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u00fccs","Muluye Yared Yaregal","Mikl\u00f3s Kozlovszky"],"author_count":3,"title":"MedAR Medical Augmented Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"IWOBI","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781728109688","id":"2e4988ac2ec3eaf0d66181685b37cccb3\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2018,"author_first":"Iwai, Daisuke","authors":["Daisuke Iwai","Yuta Itoh","Parinya Punpongsanon"],"author_count":3,"title":"Computational Augmented Reality Displays.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"ISS","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781450356947","id":"2862895f0c8f36b43711ca98ab21c1b27\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2018,"author_first":"Sweere, Dirk J.

Exact measurements can be tedious, leading most patients to estimate their carbohydrate intake. In the presented pilot study a smartphone application (BEAR), that guides the estimation of the amounts of carbohydrates, was used by a group of diabetic patients. Methods: Eight adult patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 were recruited for the study. At the beginning of the study patients were introduced to BEAR in sessions lasting 45 minutes per patient. Patients redraw the real food in 3D on the smartphone screen. Based on a selected food type and the 3D form created using BEAR an estimation of carbohydrate content is calculated. Patients were supplied with the application on their personal smartphone or a loaner device and were instructed to use the application in real-world context during the study period. For evaluation purpose a test measuring carbohydrate estimation quality was designed and performed at the beginning and the end of the study. Results: In 44% of the estimations performed at the end of the study the error reduced by at least 6 grams of carbohydrate. This improvement occurred albeit several problems with the usage of BEAR were reported. Conclusions: Despite user interaction problems in this group of patients the provided intervention resulted in a reduction in the absolute error of carbohydrate estimation. Intervention with smartphone applications to assist carbohydrate counting apparently results in more accurate estimations.","booktitle":null,"journal":"Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology","tags":["AR","myown","diabetes_education","carbohydrate_counting","augmented_reality","mHealth","eHealth"],"isbn":null,"id":"2a2739533dc5e0f0520e6cd7fb6231886\/domi"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2010,"author_first":"Liu, Damon Shing-Min","authors":["Damon Shing-Min Liu","Chun-Hao Yung","Cheng-Hsuan Chung"],"author_count":3,"title":"A Cross-Platform Framework for Physics-Based Collaborative Augmented Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Smart Graphics","journal":null,"tags":["collaboration","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"isbn":"9783642135439","id":"263ecc99a6868316efa0970a574bc68dc\/kw"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2010,"author_first":"Langlotz, T.","authors":["T.

The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and wordgesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.","booktitle":null,"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"22af6590de4950cf45fd1d898e0825a94\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2018,"author_first":"Rau, Pei-Luen Patrick","authors":["Pei-Luen Patrick Rau","Jian Zheng","Zhi Guo","Jiaqi Li"],"author_count":4,"title":"Speed reading on virtual reality and augmented reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Comput.

During the first experiment 15 camera positions with five levels of height displacement and three levels of depth displacement were compared in four different tasks. Using a two-way ANOVA the comparison of the calculated performance characteristic values showed significant influence of height displacement on hand-eye coordination. In conclusion cameras should be placed above or below eye level, but by no more than 35 mm, in order to preserve hand-eye coordination. In the second experiment, a mirror system was used to check hand-eye coordination in an exemplary medical task allowing the cameras to be placed virtually at eye level. A significant decrease in accuracy was found while using the head-mounted display compared to direct view. Finally, the mirror system was compared to the 15 camera positions using the data from the same tasks. Significant differences in performance were found between the mirror system and eye level position as well as the position slightly below eye level. The results of the experiment provide design recommendations for developers and users of video see-through systems.","booktitle":null,"journal":"The Ergonomics Open Journal","tags":["Augmented_Reality","Hand-eye_Coordination","Video_see-through","itegpub","mmspub"],"isbn":null,"id":"21b0c97d5470d5af7f9e981bd0a2eecfb\/sdt"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2007,"author_first":"Harders, Matthias","authors":["Matthias Harders","G\u00e9rald Bianchi","Benjamin Knoerlein"],"author_count":3,"title":"Multimodal Augmented Reality in Medicine.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"HCI (6)","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9783540732808","id":"27cb7895106c3c40d294f9de21cfa52c7\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2014,"author_first":"Restivo, Maria Teresa","authors":["Maria Teresa Restivo","Maria de F\u00e1tima Chouzal","Jos\u00e9 Rodrigues","Paulo Menezes","Bruno Patr\u00e3o","Joaquim Bernardino Lopes"],"author_count":6,"title":"Augmented Reality in Electrical Fundamentals.","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"Int.

The high amount of data collected with\n                  LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM\n                  approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data\n                  for realistic rendering and simulation\n                  problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to\n                  be transformed into representations that fulfill the\n                  computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In\n                  this tutorial participants will be introduced to\n                  state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing\n                  and surface reconstruction with open source software\n                  to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by\n                  interleaved presentations, software demonstrations\n                  and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point\n                  cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d\n                  trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in\n                  C\/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes\n                  and other meshing methods will play another central\n                  role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point\n                  cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering,\n                  segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface\n                  reconstruction will be provided. Participants are\n                  invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows\n                  laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical\n                  problems occuring when working with large scale 3D\n                  point clouds in VR and AR applications.","booktitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented\n                  Reality Adjunct (ISMAR-Adjunct '08)","journal":null,"tags":["imported","myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"2f9050049d946f9ae665f8df32fc29d1a\/nuechter76"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"phdthesis","year":2013,"author_first":"Zarrouati-Vissi\u00e8re, Nad\u00e8ge","authors":["Nad\u00e8ge Zarrouati-Vissi\u00e8re"],"author_count":1,"title":"Augmented reality : the fusion of vision and navigation.

Man neigt dazu, das Bild der Holobench aus Star Trek in die Realit\u00e4t zu \u00fcbertragen. Virtuelle Objekte schmiegen sich perfekt in die Realit\u00e4t ein und sind nicht mehr von anderen zu unterscheiden. Die Zukunft ist nicht vorherzusehen, aber in den kommenden Jahren werden virtuelle Objekte noch als solche erkennbar sein. Sie werden nicht genau platziert sein, werden hier und da im Bild springen und nicht die plastische Tiefe von echten Gegenst\u00e4nden haben. Wie bei der VR sind die Erwartungen sehr hoch gesteckt und mit den in Augenblick zu Verf\u00fcgung stehenden Mitteln nicht erreichbar. Es mag zu erwarten sein, dass die Kosten f\u00fcr qualitativ hochwertige Ausr\u00fcstung und der zeitliche Aufwand, um ein AR-System in Betrieb zu nehmen, in den kommenden Jahren sinken. Die Leistung von Grafikkarten und Prozessoren scheint in immer neue Dimensionen vorzusto\u00dfen und AR Frameworks werden langsam erwachsen.","booktitle":"Augmented Reality","journal":null,"tags":["bought","augmentedreality"],"isbn":"9783642141799","id":"22a1cb085b3116871402317e5a9e1c244\/kw"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2011,"author_first":"Kolstee, Yolande","authors":["Yolande Kolstee","Wim van Eck"],"author_count":2,"title":"The augmented Van Gogh's: Augmented reality experiences for museum visitors.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"ISMAR-AMH","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9781467300575","id":"2f2a09959a705be76e8ef03c471d49f54\/dblp"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2006,"author_first":"Doswell, Jayfus T.","authors":["Jayfus T.

Luczak"],"author_count":4,"title":"Evaluation von AR-Realisierungen in der Produktion","abstract":"Im Produktionsbereich bilden Montaget\u00e4tigkeiten am Ende der Produktionskette einen sehr wichtigen Bestandteil der Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette. Landau et al. (2001) schreiben von \u00fcber einer Million Montagearbeitspl\u00e4tzen in der Fahrzeug- und Elektroindustrie sowie im Maschinen und Anlagenbau. Auch die manuelle Montage ist in vielen Bereichen der Industrie weit verbreitet, sie stellt einen wesentlichen Bestandteil der Produktions- und Servicebereiche der in diesem Sektor arbeitenden Unternehmen dar. Mit dem Aufkommen von Augmented Reality (AR) als neuer Form der Mensch-Rechner-Interaktion er\u00f6ffnen sich Potentiale zur Unterst\u00fctzung an Montagearbeitspl\u00e4tzen, die sich auch auf die Arbeitsorganisation auswirken. Gegenstand dieses Kapitels ist die Untersuchung von AR-Systemen unter m\u00f6glichst realistischen Bedingungen an realen Montagearbeitspl\u00e4tzen. Im Gegensatz zu den bei Wiedenmaier (2004) beschrieben quantitativen Untersuchungen zur Einsetzbarkeit von AR-Technologien in der manuellen Montage und der quantitativen Evaluation von verbesserten Darstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten von virtuellen Objekten gehen die hier gew\u00e4hlten Beispiele auf einem qualitativen Niveau einen Schritt weiter. In den beiden Montageszenarien werden alle Arbeitst\u00e4tigkeiten und damit die gesamten Arbeitspl\u00e4tze neu gestaltet und mit den zuk\u00fcnftigen Arbeitspersonen qualitativ evaluiert. Ein weiterer interessanter Ansatz ist der einer Produktion vorgelagerte Bereich der kooperativen Anlagenplanung. Dabei k\u00f6nnen Kooperationspartner aus verschiedenen, r\u00e4umlich verteilten Unternehmensteilen oder einzelnen Unternehmen eine Produktionsanlage planen. Der Evaluationsfokus liegt im Bereich der Wirtschaftlichkeit eines Einsatzes von AR-Netcollaboration. Im Gegensatz zu den beiden Montageszenarien, bei denen aufgrund der permanenten Arbeit mit den AR-Systemen das Usability Engineering im Mittelpunkt steht, wird hier vor allem die Zeit- und Kostenersparnis in den Vordergrund gestellt. Dennoch darf auf bei der kooperativen Anlagenplanung die Benutzbarkeit nicht au\u00dfer Acht gelassen werden.","booktitle":"Benutzerzentrierte Gestaltung von Augmented-Reality-Systemen","journal":null,"tags":["Augmented_Reality","Montage","Arbeitssystemgestaltung","ARVIKA","mmspub","Produktion"],"isbn":null,"id":"28da11eb9ce5d48c72f3f8a35d671c92e\/sdt"},{"search_string":"ar","pup_type":"article","year":2019,"author_first":"Huang, Kuo-Ting","authors":["Kuo-Ting Huang","Christopher Ball","Jessica Francis","Rabindra A.

Delving into the Reality-Virtuality Continuum, we find Mixed Reality \u2013 systems designed to augment the physical world with virtual entities that embody characteristics of real world objects. In the medical field, Mixed Reality systems can overlay real-time and spatially accurate results onto a patient\u2019s body without the need for external screens. The complexity of these systems previously required specialized prototypes, but newly available commercial products like the Microsoft HoloLens make the technology more available. Through a combination of literature review, expert analysis, and prototyping we explore the use of Mixed Reality in this setting. From the experience of prototyping HoloSim and Patiently, two applications for augmenting medical training and education, we outline considerations for the future design and development of virtual interfaces grounded in reality.","booktitle":"Proceedings of CHI 2017 (Late Breaking), ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","journal":null,"tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"2078e221281064c5f05bf58cc3172f025\/weibel"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2013,"author_first":"Giebler-Schubert, Anke","authors":["Anke Giebler-Schubert","Chris Zimmerer","Thomas Wedler","Martin Fischbach","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":5,"title":"Ein digitales Tabletop-Rollenspiel f\u00fcr Mixed-Reality-Interaktionstechniken","abstract":"Dieser Artikel beschreibt die digitale Umsetzung eines rollenspielbasierten Brettspiels zur Exploration neuer Interaktionstechniken.

In the medical field, Mixed Reality systems can overlay real-time and spatially accurate results onto a patient's body without the need for external screens. The complexity of these systems previously required specialized prototypes, but newly available commercial products like the Microsoft HoloLens make the technology more available.

We believe the CSCW community can play an essential and unique role in examining and designing the next generation of mixed reality games and technologies that support them.

So - for example - museum displays can be augmented with added information about their history and provenance, and this information delivered to a visitor via their mobile telephone as they pass in front of the display. An increasing number of systems are exploiting mixed reality but to date there are no systematic methods, techniques or guidelines for the development of such systems. In bringing together contributions on a broad range of mixed reality development issues this book provides a sound theoretical foundation for a disciplined approach to mixed reality engineering. Divided into three parts, interaction design, software design and implementation, this book brings together state of the art developments in the engineering of mixed reality systems, addressing issues at these three levels. Part 1 covers generic and specific mixed reality design elements and provides an overview of the design method; Part 2 addresses technical solutions for interaction techniques, development tools and a global view of the mixed reality software development process. Finally part 3 contains detailed case studies to highlight the application of mixed reality in a variety of fields including aviation, architecture, emergency management, games, and healthcare. Multimodal and tangible interaction designers, systems engineers working in augmented reality and ubiquitous systems, human factors researchers, and others interested in the use of mixed reality techniques in their work, will find this book a useful addition to their bookshelf.","booktitle":null,"journal":null,"tags":["development","software","crisis","book","ai","graphics","team","multimodal","01624","interface","health","3d","103","management","design","interaction","user","springer","embedded","architecture"],"isbn":"9781848827325","id":"2b65fcb73470f460722b4806753465eee\/flint63"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"article","year":2012,"author_first":"Selonen, Petri","authors":["Petri Selonen","Petros Belimpasakis","Yu You","Timo Pylv\u00e4n\u00e4inen","Severi Uusitalo"],"author_count":5,"title":"Mixed Reality Web Service Platform","abstract":"This paper presents a RESTful Web service platform for applications for both Web browsers and mobile clients.

Traditionally such photographs were ac- quired using airplanes or satellites, and later processed in order to generate a virtual environment (VE). The industrial research project AVIGLE explores novel approaches to multimodal remote sensing by using a swarm of Miniature Un- manned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs), which are equipped with different sensing and network technologies. The acquired data will be sent in quasi-real time to a ground control sta- tion, where a VE will be generated automatically. Although this approach introduces a new low-cost alternative to the traditional remote sensing processes, it opens up numerous research and engineering challenges. In this position paper we introduce a mixed reality (MR)-based simulation framework, which has been developed in the scope of the AVIGLE project. The main idea for this framework is to create a con- trolled environment in which parts of the system are real, whereas other parts are virtual and can be simulated for testing purposes. This MR simulation framework is intended to use virtual and real sensing technology in combination to provide a flexible solution to simulate and evaluate different hardware setups and algorithms.","booktitle":"IUI Workshop on Location Awareness for Mixed and Dual Reality (LAMDa)","journal":null,"tags":["framework","myown","reality","simulation","mixed","multimodal"],"isbn":null,"id":"2fbee5029886129c591ee7804bde314c0\/mcm"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2019,"author_first":"Williams, Tom","authors":["Tom Williams","Matthew Bussing","Sebastian Cabrol","Elizabeth Boyle","Nhan Tran"],"author_count":5,"title":"Mixed Reality Deictic Gesture for Multi-Modal Robot Communication","abstract":"In previous work, researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that robots' use of deictic gestures enables effective and natural human-robot interaction.

Even when step by step instructions are available, most bystanders do not attempt resuscitation due to panic or fear of failing, often at the cost of the victim's life. We propose Mixed Reality (MR) as a compelling medium to support time-critical emergencies, and study its use in this context through an iterative user-centered design process. Our research outlines a number of key considerations for the design of time-critical emergency interfaces that led to the creation of HoloCPR, an MR application providing real-time instructions for resuscitation through a combination of visual and spatial cues. HoloCPR's comparative evaluation during a realistic resuscitation scenario indicates how the use of MR can result in decreased reaction time and increased procedural accuracy. With this work, we hope to bootstrap a new wave of MR applications for time-critical emergencies that can be included in first aid kits in the future.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 12th EAI International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare","journal":null,"tags":["Augmented","Design","Reality,","Mixed","User-Centered","Checklists,","HoloLens,","CPR,"],"isbn":"9781450364508","id":"2a21714fba3be70fa4b17124b26cb0117\/weibel"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2006,"author_first":"T\u00f6nnies, Sascha","authors":["Sascha T\u00f6nnies","Volker Paelke","Claus Brenner"],"author_count":3,"title":"Zielf\u00fchrung in der Fahrzeugnavigation mittels Mixed Reality","abstract":"Fahrzeugnavigationssysteme (FNS) sind komplexe Einheiten, die Funktionen zur Ortung, Routenplanung und Zielf\u00fchrung unter Echtzeitanforderungen zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen.

This research contributes ways in which mixed reality game UIs can focus players on the physical environment, leveraging its unique affordances.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2015 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play","journal":null,"tags":["myown","modalities","systems","multimedia","display","head-mounted","reality","games","mixed","information","handheld","displays"],"isbn":"9781450334662","id":"2f143fb8968a01123c94c0fadda846b5a\/toupsz"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"incollection","year":2009,"author_first":"Costanza, Enrico","authors":["Enrico Costanza","Andreas Kunz","Morten Fjeld"],"author_count":3,"title":"Mixed Reality: A Survey","abstract":"This chapter presents an overview of the Mixed Reality (MR) paradigm, which proposes to overlay our real-world environment with digital, computer-generated objects.

While the potential of AR for applications such as geo-visualization has been shown using a number of demonstration systems, there are virtually no systems in daily use up to now. This is mainly due to technical reasons. Besides suitable displays, there is a lack of reliable and accurate tracking systems, which are however required for an exact registration of the virtual contents and the real scene. Additionally, there is a lack of experience and tools for the creation of mixed reality applications and often, of intuitive interaction techniques. Especially for applications involving public audience (e.g. exhibitions, museums, public participation), additional requirements apply, such as reliability, robustness, easy adaptation to different users, and the necessity for relatively low operating expenses. In this paper, we introduce the GeoScope, a mixed-reality input\/output device, which addresses those problems, especially for public applications. The GeoScope is mounted at a fixed position and consists of a display, oriented towards the user, and a camera, which points at the surroundings. Just as a telescope, the GeoScope can be turned around two axes, the two angles being captured by measuring devices. Together with the known position, a fast and highly precise tracking of the current view direction is possible, allowing the superposition of the real scene, as delivered by the camera, and virtually generated information.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 25th Urban Data Management Symposium (UDMS\u201906), May 15-17, 2006, Aalborg, Denmark","journal":null,"tags":["information_visualization","myown","augmented_reality"],"isbn":null,"id":"21a12cb03ae4812dd3cc6bb81810324d5\/haunert"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2016,"author_first":"Kawagoe, Maho","authors":["Maho Kawagoe","Mai Otsuki","Fumihisa Shibata","Asako Kimura"],"author_count":4,"title":"Sharpen Your Carving Skills in Mixed Reality Space","abstract":"This paper proposes a virtual carving system using ToolDevice in a mixed reality (MR) space.

This paper investigates the impact of incongruencies on the sensation\/perception and cognition layers to provoke breaks in plausibility, and the effects these breaks have on spatial and overall presence as prominent constructs of Virtual Reality (VR). We developed a simulated maintenance application to test virtual electrical devices. Participants performed test operations on these devices in a counterbalanced, randomized 2x2 between-subject design in either VR as congruent, or Augmented Reality (AR) as incongruent on the sensation\/perception layer. Cognitive incongruency was induced by the absence of traceable power outages, decoupling perceived cause and effect after activating potentially defective devices. Our results indicate significant differences in the plausibility ratings between the VR and AR conditions, hence between congruent\/incongruent conditions on the sensation\/perception layer. In addition, spatial presence revealed a comparable interaction pattern with the VR vs AR conditions. Both factors decreased for the AR condition (incongruent sensation\/perception) compared to VR (congruent sensation\/perception) for the congruent cognitive case but increased for the incongruent cognitive case. The results are discussed and put into perspective in the scope of recent theories of MR experiences.","booktitle":null,"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)","tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"2919397417f6b97397a097d8c61b5d903\/hci-uwb"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2013,"author_first":"Giebler-Schubert, Anke","authors":["Anke Giebler-Schubert","Chris Zimmerer","Thomas Wedler","Martin Fischbach","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":5,"title":"Ein digitales Tabletop-Rollenspiel f\u00fcr Mixed-Reality-Interaktionstechniken","abstract":"Dieser Artikel beschreibt die digitale Umsetzung eines rollenspielbasierten Brettspiels zur Exploration neuer Interaktionstechniken.

The benefit of our approach is that it adds physical forces while keeping the users' hands free to interact unencumbered-not only with virtual objects, but also with physical objects, such as props and appliances. We demonstrate how this supports three classes of applications along the mixed-reality continuum: (1) entirely virtual objects, such as furniture with EMS friction when pushed or an EMS-based catapult game. (2) Virtual objects augmented via passive props with EMS-constraints, such as a light control panel made tangible by means of a physical cup or a balance-the-marble game with an actuated tray. (3) Augmented appliances with virtual behaviors, such as a physical thermostat dial with EMS-detents or an escape-room that repurposes lamps as levers with detents. We present a user-study in which participants rated the EMS-feedback as significantly more realistic than a no-EMS baseline.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","journal":null,"tags":["ar","interaction"],"isbn":"9781450356206","id":"2deda20e3654ccd98c97fcddfb3cc5f0b\/gon"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2014,"author_first":"Fischbach, Martin","authors":["Martin Fischbach","Chris Zimmerer","Anke Giebler-Schubert","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":4,"title":"DEMO Exploring multimodal interaction techniques for a mixed reality digital surface","abstract":null,"booktitle":"International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","journal":null,"tags":["myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"23f14b432a931d814c02aebe756d15e99\/anke.gs"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"incollection","year":2008,"author_first":null,"authors":null,"author_count":0,"title":"Mixed Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Encyclopedia of Multimedia","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"9780387784144","id":"283cb06f52897f967cfd42db75814f278\/dblp"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"incollection","year":2019,"author_first":"Kasapakis, Vlasios","authors":["Vlasios Kasapakis","Damianos Gavalas","Elena Dzardanova"],"author_count":3,"title":"Mixed Reality.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Encyclopedia of Computer Graphics and Games","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"29329133321f19a55051e055bcd5054f4\/dblp"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"article","year":2007,"author_first":"T\u00f6nnies, Sascha","authors":["Sascha T\u00f6nnies"],"author_count":1,"title":"Neue Techniken in der Fahrzeugnavigation: Mixed Reality als Schl\u00fcsseltechnologie","abstract":null,"booktitle":null,"journal":"GIS-BUSINESS Geoinformationstechnologie f\u00fcr die Praxis","tags":["myown","2007","Navigation"],"isbn":null,"id":"2fedd4927a58bb50ef7040b50944bf6e9\/toennies"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2021,"author_first":"Mi\u0161iak, Martin","authors":["Martin Mi\u0161iak","Arnulph Fuhrmann","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"author_count":3,"title":"Impostor-Based Rendering Acceleration for Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality","abstract":"This paper presents an image-based rendering approach to accelerate rendering time of virtual scenes containing a large number of complex high poly count objects.

Particularly, mixed reality can help project initiators to visualize the planned changes to the city landscape in an easy and understandable way, enabling people to participate in a creative manner. However, this technology is challenging for most project initiators, as it requires an extensive technical and\/or domain experience. Besides that, specialized hardware and experienced staff is required. An easy on-boarding process, which introduces mixed reality step-by-step and offers assistance by external service providers could promote both adoption and usage. In this paper, we present the design process and resulting concept of a configurator for a public participation platform, that aims to guide initiators with different levels of technical knowledge. Besides detailing the design and development process of the prototype, we will present the preliminary results of our evaluation. The interview partners provided positive feedback on the usage of our configurator. Moreover, different approaches are necessary for the public and private sector when configuring and purchasing their participation solution. Finally, we highlight areas that are still in need of further work, such as the compliance with the regulations for public institutions and address further promising areas of research.","booktitle":"rtsIT, Interactivity and Game Creation.

We examine two new modalities: gaze input and output in the peripheral field of view. All modalities are considered in the whole spectrum of the mixed-reality continuum. We show the added value of these new forms of multimodal interaction in two important application domains: Automotive User Interfaces and Human-Robot Collaboration. We present experiments that analyze gaze under various conditions and help to design a 3D model for peripheral vision. Furthermore, this work presents several new algorithms for eye-based interaction, like deictic reference in mobile scenarios, for non-intrusive user identification, or exploiting the peripheral field view for advanced multimodal presentations. These algorithms have been integrated into a number of software tools for eye-based interaction, which are used to implement 15 use cases for intelligent environment applications. These use cases cover a wide spectrum of applications, from spatial interactions with a rapidly changing environment from within a moving vehicle, to mixed-reality interaction between teams of human and robots.","booktitle":null,"journal":null,"tags":["image","zzz.mmi","book","ai","analysis","01801","multimodal","interface","dfki","103","interaction","user","algorithm"],"isbn":null,"id":"21b552f1d76c2847dd1ac62adfe0505d2\/flint63"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inbook","year":2009,"author_first":"Bernardet, Ulysses","authors":["Ulysses Bernardet","Sergi Bermudez i Badia","Armin Duff","Martin Inderbitzin","Sylvain Le Groux","Jonatas Manzolli","Zenon Mathews","Anna Mura","Aleksander Valjamae","Paul F.

In this paper, we propose a mobile mixed reality guide system for indoor environments, Chloe@University. A mobile computing device (Sony's Ultra Mobile PC) is hidden inside a jacket and a user selects a destination inside a building through voice commands. A 3D virtual assistant then appears in the see-through HMD and guides him\/her to destination. Thus, the user simply follows the virtual guide. Chloe@University also suggests the most suitable virtual character (e.g. human guide, dog, cat, etc.) based on user preferences and profiles. Depending on user profiles, different security levels and authorizations for content are previewed. Concerning indoor location tracking, WiFi, RFID, and sensor-based methods are integrated in this system to have maximum flexibility. Moreover smart and transparent wireless connectivity provides the user terminal with fast and seamless transition among Access Points (APs). Different AR navigation approaches have been studied: Olwal 2006, Elmqvist et al. and Newman et al. work indoors while Bell et al. 2002 and Reitmayr and Drummond 2006 are employed outdoors. Accurate tracking and registration is still an open issue and recently it has mostly been tackled by no single method, but mostly through aggregation of tracking and localization methods, mostly based on handheld AR. A truly wearable, HMD based mobile AR navigation aid for both indoors and outdoors with rich 3D content remains an open issue and a very active field of multi-discipline research.","booktitle":"Proceedings of the 2007 ACM symposium on Virtual reality software and technology","journal":null,"tags":["coauthor","co-author"],"isbn":"9781595938633","id":"2e93be0b80d40337a09711fe85f6ce1b2\/afragop"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2017,"author_first":"Rick, Steven","authors":["Steven Rick","Vish Ramesh","Danilo Gasques Rodrigues","Nadir Weibel"],"author_count":4,"title":"Pervasive Sensing in Healthcare: From Observing and Collecting to Seeing and Understanding","abstract":"From analyzing complex socio-technical systems, to evaluating novel interactions, increasingly pervasive sensing technologies provide researchers with new ways to observe the world.

At the same time novel multimodal signal processing and machine learning techniques are equipping us with 'super powers' that enable understanding of these data in real-time, opening up new opportunities for embracing the concept of 'Data Science in the Wild'. In this paper we present what this transition means in the context of Health and Healthcare, focusing on how it leads to the 'UbiScope', a ubiquitous computing microscope for detecting particular health conditions in real-time, promoting reflection on care, and guiding medical practices.

The high amount of data collected with\n                  LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM\n                  approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data\n                  for realistic rendering and simulation\n                  problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to\n                  be transformed into representations that fulfill the\n                  computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In\n                  this tutorial participants will be introduced to\n                  state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing\n                  and surface reconstruction with open source software\n                  to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by\n                  interleaved presentations, software demonstrations\n                  and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point\n                  cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d\n                  trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in\n                  C\/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes\n                  and other meshing methods will play another central\n                  role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point\n                  cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering,\n                  segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface\n                  reconstruction will be provided. Participants are\n                  invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows\n                  laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical\n                  problems occuring when working with large scale 3D\n                  point clouds in VR and AR applications.","booktitle":"IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented\n                  Reality Adjunct (ISMAR-Adjunct '08)","journal":null,"tags":["imported","myown"],"isbn":null,"id":"2f9050049d946f9ae665f8df32fc29d1a\/nuechter76"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2016,"author_first":"Blank, Christian","authors":["Christian Blank","Birgit Wendholt","Jonathan Wischhusen"],"author_count":3,"title":"Mobile Mixed Reality Repair Kit.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"Mensch & Computer","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":null,"id":"24283aaa4c4083e1f7b44c72c5768aee0\/dblp"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2006,"author_first":"Regenbrecht, Holger","authors":["Holger Regenbrecht","Daniel Wickeroth","Brian Dixon","Stefan M\u00fcller"],"author_count":4,"title":"Collaborative Mixed Reality Exposure Therapy.","abstract":null,"booktitle":"CW","journal":null,"tags":["dblp"],"isbn":"0769526713","id":"2b142bc98b4ac6e11f2da323727baa0a9\/dblp"},{"search_string":"mr","pup_type":"inproceedings","year":2008,"author_first":"Perez, Camilo A.","authors":["Camilo A.
