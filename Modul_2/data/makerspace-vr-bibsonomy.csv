Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops, workshops and/or studios where hackers can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things. Many hackerspaces participate in the use and development of free software, open hardware, and alternative media. They are often physically located in infoshops, social centers, adult education centers, or on university campuses, but may relocate to industrial or warehouse space when they need more room..""",2012-10-09 01:05:34,2012-10-09 01:26:10,1,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspaces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,makerspace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Makerspaces are, simply put, places where people gather to make things. Although that may sound like a simplistic definition, the things that can be created in a makerspace vary a great deal. Makerspaces can be high tech, low tech, and everything in between. A makerspace's offerings revolve around the needs of the community it serves, but the one thing all have in common is that they bring people together to share ideas. Typically, the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about mak- erspaces is 3D printing, but when it comes to what’s going on in makerspaces around the world, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Makers create things, ideas, and concepts. Makers work in metal, wood, plastic, fabric, paper, and digital forms. From robotics to crocheting, there are no limits to your makerspace. Let your imagination run wild. In this chapter, we’ll provide the information and ideas to get your maker-spaces up and running based on your unique populations and budgets. You’ll find a myriad of ways to create your makerspace.

Linguistic analysis as a data mining technique holds promise for revealing different dimensions of learning exhibited by students in makerspaces. In this study, student reflections on makerspace projects were gathered in 2 formats over 2 years: private written assessments captured in the 3D GameLab gamification platform, and semi-public video-recorded assessments posted in the more social FlipGrid platform. Transcripts of student assessments were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) to generate 4 summary variables thought to inform makerspace outcomes of interest (i.e. analytical thinking, authenticity, clout, and emotional tone). Comparative findings indicate that written assessments may elicit more analytical thinking about maker projects compared with less analytical conversation in videos, while video assessments may elicit somewhat higher clout scores as evidence of social scaffolding along with a much more positive emotional tone. Recommendations are provided for layering assessment approaches to maximize the potential benefits of each format, including reflective writing for social spaces, in social groups, and about design processes and procedures.",,,Oliver2020,International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education,1573-1774,10.1007/s10763-020-10060-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,makerspace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four objectives  guided the study: what constituted makerspace in academic library, the level of awareness of makerspace by academic library benefits and challenges of adopting makerspace in libraries. The descriptive survey design was adopted and questionnaire was used for data collection. The population of the study comprised of professional and paraprofessional librarians of Ambrose University and University of Benin, from which a sample size of 119 was drawn using total enumeration sampling technique. Out of the 119 copies of questionnaire administered, 94 were retrieved and analyzed using simple percentage and frequency tables. Findings revealed that, the respondents were aware of what constitute makerspace which are library space, 3D printers, computers and projector. It was also discovered that, the respondents had a high level of awareness of makerspace in the library. Some of the benefits associated with the use of makerspace are: it facilitates group interaction, it improves knowledge and provides access to wide varieties of tools and technology. Some of the challenges encountered in the adoption of makerspace are training of academic library staff, security of makerspace gadgets, poor funding, erratic power supply, high cost and maintenance of equipment. It was however recommended that; librarians should make deliberate effort to explore the potentials in makerspace in the enhancement of their services and training should be conducted regularly to enhance librarian’s skills in the use of ICTs Kingsley Efe OSAWARU, Angela Ishioma DIME and Emordi Herbert OKONJO 2020.

This original research study ask two key questions: How is learning achieved and supported in makerspaces? What can academic library services bring to the effective organisation and support of makerspaces?

Design/methodology/approach

An extensive literature review is followed by a template analysis (King, 2012) of data from an online forum of three professionals operating makerspaces in academic library services in the USA and a discussion incorporating relevant educational theory and philosophy.

Findings

The three overarching learning themes found were: experiential learning (Dewey, 1909; Kolb, 1984), communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991) and self-efficacy through social learning (Bandura, 1997).

Research limitations/implications

The one-week forum of three professional library staff provided detailed and informative data. Substantial field work with students will also be required to see how far this professional lens has provided insight into how students are learning and supported in these and other makerspaces.

Social implications

The wider cultural implications are examined, including the potential social value of makerspaces as transformative creative spaces empowering communities and individuals.

Originality/value

This is the first study to date on the potential educational value of makerspaces within HE, and the specific support academic library services can offer if they choose to host a makerspace (including teaching information, digital and critical literacies).",,en,Curry.2017,Library Review,0024-2535,10.1108/LR-09-2016-0081,,,66,,4/5,,,,,,,,makerspace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the poster is to present Makerspace as a bridge that connects Traditional Library and emerging technologies such as 3D printing, Coding, sustainable design, Virtual Reality and etc. Makerspace is a successful service from National Library of Lithuania that proved to be a good way to attract new users and strengthen library‘s community. In almost 3 years‘ time 10000 users have used our services and discovered library in a new and exiting way. IFLA WLIC 2019 main topic “Dialogue for change“ was exactly what we wanted to communicate through bringing our expertise to the conference. Our successful service is a great way to encourage other libraries to take on courageous initiatives, unconventional solutions and open the libraries‘ door to meet technological changes that are forming new way of learning, communicating, sharing and creating.

The public libraries in the Central district of Berlin are embracing this important means of training by not only offering two permanent Makerspaces in two of their branches, but also by introducing a mobile MakerBus which will bring different formats to the community where needed. This new expanded service will serve our users in different ways: one Makerspace will focus further on digital skills by offering drone building classes, 3D printing and robotics; the second one will focus on more manual competences like sewing, stitching and hand-lettering but also embrace technology by offering a low-level introduction to photo and film making. The MakerBus will combine the best of both Makerspaces, offering modules in 3D printing, programming, sewing, and on top a small mobile workshop for fixing bikes and small electrical items, encouraging responsible consumption and less waste. We truly believe that by investing in and expanding these services, the Central district of Berlin will present its library users with the best in digital literacy education resting on three solid pillars of learning.",,en,Banford.,,,,,,,,,,Poster,,,,,,makerspace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Die Master-Thesis untersucht das Potential von Urban Gardening Makerspaces für 
Öffentliche Bibliotheken. Die Arbeit steht im Kontext der Neuentwicklung 
bibliothekarischer Dienstleistungen in der digitalen Gesellschaft. Ausgangspunkt der 
Thesis stellen die aktuellen gesellschaftlichen Entwicklungen zum Do-it-Yourself 
(DIY), zum Sharing und der Maker-Bewegung dar. Diese Entwicklungen üben großen 
Einfluss auf die Debatte um den Wandel von Bibliotheken aus und legen die 
Grundlage, Makerspaces und Community Building als zentrale zukünftige 
Arbeitsfelder für Öffentliche Bibliothek zu betrachten. Dem wird der Trend zum Urban 
Gardening gegenübergestellt. Zentral ist die These, dass Urban Gardening keine 
Abkehr von der digitalen Gesellschaft darstellt, sondern vielmehr eine Ausprägung 
des DIY und der Maker-Bewegung ist. Diese Sichtweise ermöglicht es, Parallelen 
zwischen Urban Gardening und Makerspaces abzuleiten, was die Grundlage für die 
Einbindung von Urban Gardening Makerspaces in eine bibliothekarische Praxis 
darstellt.
Urban Gardening Makerspaces werden zudem mit der Idee der grünen Bibliothek 
sowie der sustainable library verknüpft, wofür die Thesis eine Begriffserweiterung zur 
ökologisch und sozial nachhaltigen Bibliotheksarbeit anbietet. Anschließend werden 
die Potentiale von Urban Gardening und Öffentlicher Bibliotheken im Rahmen 
aktueller Tendenzen der Stadtentwicklung beleuchtet. Ein abschließender Leitfaden 
soll Öffentlichen Bibliotheken als Vorlage dienen, eigene Ideen zu entwickeln und 
Urban Gardening Makerspaces einzurichten.

Abstract (english)
In the context of the development of new library services in the digital age, this 
Master’s thesis investigates the potential of Urban Gardening Makerspaces in public 
libraries. It is argued that current trends in society like DIY, sharing or the maker 
movement have huge influence on the discussion of public library services in the 
digital age. They also provide the groundwork for makerspaces and community 
building as one of the main parts of future library services. This development is 
combined with the urban gardening trend.
One main aspect of this thesis is the understanding, that urban gardening is an 
essential part of the digital age and not its counterpart. Urban gardening has lots of 
characteristics of the DIY and maker movement. Regarding urban gardening and 
community gardens as makerspaces gives the basis to combine them with library 
services. 
Urban gardening makerspaces are embedded in the ideas of the green library and 
the sustainable library. Therefore, this thesis proposes a definition for ecological and 
societal sustainable library services. Afterwards the potentials of urban gardening and
public libraries and their role in urban development are highlighted. A guideline for 
public libraries for creating their own urban gardening makerspaces completes this thesis.",,de,Schumann.2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,makerspace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Public libraries hence need to demonstrate relevance to their communities, sponsors and other accountable bodies to avoid the continuance of this trend. This paper shows how libraries can link into debates in society and politics by adopting the urban gardening trend as well as developing new services around this green movement. Within the debate on public libraries’ transformation, urban gardening and the idea of the green library provide an opportunity to develop new green and sustainable library services. By combining makerspaces and community building with urban gardening and foodsharing, the public library of Bad Oldesloe developed a series of events that turned the library into a modern and creative learning space. At the same time, the library offered its physical space as a community platform for networking, cooperation and creativity.",9783110608878,en,Schumann.2018,,,10.1515/9783110608878-013,,IFLA Publications,,,,,,,,,,,makerspace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new update of Sannwald's classic guide will help you stay prepared and organized for every phase of your undertaking from conception through the dedication ceremony. Using a popular checklist format that ensures no detail is overlooked, this planner covers crucial considerations like Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) factors, structured to match the federal code; sustainable design features, including sensors that save energy and water; designing makerspaces, digital media labs, or leased library enterprises; disaster and recovery planning; creating quiet spaces; collaborative collections and materials-handling efficiency; and important virtual presence aspects to bear in mind during physical space decisions.

Es wird wieder gebastelt, geschraubt, gelötet, repariert. Werkstätten erleben heutzutage eine unerwartete Renaissance. Der Sammelbegriff „offene Werkstätten“ umfasst verschiedene Formen von
Infrastrukturen zur gemeinsamen Nutzung von Mitteln für materielle Produktion und den offenen
Austausch darüber. Konkret handelt es sich um gemeinwohlorientierte Repair Cafés, Siebdruckwerkstätten und Fahrradreparaturinitiativen, aber auch um gewerblich orientierte FabLabs und Hackerspaces.
Die gewachsene Bedeutung und die gestiegene Zahl der offenen Werkstätten sind Ausdruck und
Ergebnis sich verändernder Produktions- und Innovationsbedingungen in der Wirtschaft. Dezentralisierungsprozesse der stofflichen Produktion, die durch die technisch avancierten Ausprägungen
offener Werkstätten vorangetrieben werden, können sich auch transformativ auf andere Branchen
auswirken. Entsprechend dieser Dynamiken wurden offene Werkstätten als vielschichtige Orte untersucht, um sowohl Nachhaltigkeits- als auch Innovationspotenziale in den Blick zu nehmen.
Im Sommer 2015 richteten wir eine Befragung an 453 offene Werkstätten in Deutschland, um deren Innovations- und Arbeitsprozesse genauer in den Blick zu nehmen. Auf der Basis eines Datensamples von 103 Antwortsätzen (Rücklaufquote 23 %) rekonstruiert die vorliegende Studie die
sozialen, materiellen und ökonomischen Wirkungsprozesse in diesen Werkstätten.
Die starke Dynamik des Phänomens zeigt sich unter anderem daran, dass die meisten Antwortenden der offenen Werkstatt zwischen 2013 und 2015 beigetreten sind. Über die Hälfte hat ihre
Werkstatt selbst mitbegründet. Der überwiegende Teil besitzt eine naturwissenschaftliche Qualifikation.
Gemeinschaftsorientierung – nicht das materielle Endergebnis oder die Herstellung eines Gegenstandes – ist der Hauptgrund für das Engagement in offenen Werkstätten. Die persönliche Motivation der Aktiven liegt weniger im ökonomischen Bereich als vielmehr in der Vermittlung von Wissen, dem praktischen Arbeiten und in einer gesellschaftlichen Transformation. Das Erproben neuer sozialer Wege des Lernens, der Wissensvermittlung und des Zusammenarbeitens stehen im Mittelpunkt alltäglicher Praktiken in offenen Werkstätten.

Summary
Lately, there is a noticeable trend that people start doing handicrafts again. And thus open workshops experience an unexpected renaissance. The term “open workshops” comprises different
kinds of infrastructures for the shared use of resources for material production and an open exchange about it. This includes non-commercial repair cafés, screen printing workshops and initiatives for bicycle repair as well as commercially oriented fab labs and hackerspaces.
The growing number and importance of open workshops are the result of changing economic conditions for production and innovation. The decentralization of physical production, which is promoted by the technically advanced types of open workshops, may also have transformative effects
on other sectors. Multiple aspects of open workshops were investigated to assess the potentials of
these dynamics for sustainability and innovation.
To investigate the work and innovation activivties, 453 open workshops in Germany were addressed by an empirical survey in the summer 2015. Based on a data sample of 103 observations
(which corresponds to a response rate of 23 %), the social, material and economic processes
within open workshops have been reconstructed.
The strong dynamics of this phenomenon is demonstrated by the fact that the majority of the respondents joined the open workshops between 2013 and 2015. More than half of them are cofounders of the workshop. Predominantly, respondents have an educational background in natural
sciences.
Community-orientation – not the material end result or the fabrication of an object – is the principal
reason for engaging in open workshops. The personal motivations of the actors are not primarily
economic, but rather directed towards the transfer of knowledge, practical working experiences and
societal transformation. Experimentation with new social forms of learning, knowledge transfer and
collaboration is central to the everyday practice in open workshops.",,,noauthororeditor,Schriftenreihe des IÖW,,,,,213/16,,,,,,,,,,makerspace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perspektivisch entwickeln sich Bibliotheken zu virtuellen Arbeitsumgebungen, die wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in Forschung, Lehre und Studium fachspezifisch mit attraktiven Infrastrukturdiensten und Werkzeugen unterstützen und für Fach-Communities die Voraussetzungen für Interaktion und Kollaboration schaffen. In der mittelfristigen Perspektive bis 2025 haben folgende Handlungsfelder einen zentralen Stellenwert:
(1) Open Access und neue Formen der Lizenzierung
(2) Publikationsdienstleistungen
(3) Management von Forschungsdaten
(4) Überregionale Informationsversorgung für Fachcommunities
(5) Langfristige Nutzbarkeit digitaler Ressourcen

Ironically, rate of participation in FOSS-related work is far lower than in other areas of computing. A 2002 European Union study showed that fewer than 2 percent of software developers in the FOSS world were women. How is it that an intellectual community of activists so open in principle to one and all -a community that prides itself for its enlightened politics and its commitment to social change - should have such a low rate of participation by women?

The traditional standard of keyboard and mouse is not the only way we have to communicate with our computers anymore. We have entered the age of the personal digital assistant, which can deliver results with nothing but a voice command. Some of the largest technology companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon) believe that the digital agent will eventually be the primary interface we use to communicate with our computerized gadgets, the internet, and our network of interconnected devices (Internet of Things). With that belief in mind, these companies are attempting to make their version of a digital agent the de facto standard for most consumers. Each company is looking to establish a foothold in this marketspace because they believe digital agent technology is the key that will hold consumers in their respective digital ecosystems. In other words, once you use a particular digital agent and establish a connection with the software, it will be difficult to switch to a different digital agent.

The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC) is the premier international forum for researchers and industrial practitioners to discuss the theory, applications and evaluation of technologies, visual and otherwise, that enhance the role of humans in the computing process.

This year marks the 26th anniversary of the Symposium. Established in 1984, the mission of the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (""VL/HCC"") is to support the design, formalization, implementation, and evaluation of computing languages that are easier to learn, easier to use, and easier to understand by a broader group of people.

This includes all research aimed at the above mission, regardless of whether it uses entirely visual technology, text, or instead uses sound, taste, virtual reality, the web, or any other technologies. Examples of research addressing this problem include, but are not limited to, language/environmental design aspects, theory that supports the many media used toward this goal, implementation aspects, empirical work, software comprehension aspects (including software visualization), and software modeling and/or software engineering aspects.

Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) have impaired spatial abilities. This includes a deficit in spatial navigation abilities such as learning the route from A to B. To-date, to determine whether participants attend to landmarks when learning a route, landmark recall tasks have been employed after the route learning experience. Here, we combined virtual reality and eye tracking technologies, for the first time, to measure landmark use in typically developing (TD) children and participants with WS during route-learning.

Remember BigDog , the unnervingly agile quadruped Terminator robot? Well, here weve got a smaller version of this type of marching quadruped; except this time, its got a quadcopter tethered to its back, which can take to the sky from its perch and then come back to nest. Its almost like a bird that rides along on the back of a hippo. The combination quadcopter-quadruped is the product of the Autonomous Systems Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Having a little quadcopter attached to your ground robot could have many advantages. For example, the quadcopter could take to the the air to do visual recon. Or it could be deployed to retrieve something thats out of reach for the ground bot. Perhaps one day well use this frankendrone for more mundane purposes, like retrieving cats from trees. And it won?t do much damage to itself or anything else you may fly it into. See a clean, sharp image just as if you were in the pilot seat. Unlike wings providing lift on an air plane, extensive quad copter surfaces represent a significant liability in wind resistance. Under GP Flight Mode, 1 one of the most utilized GP based functions is the GPS-Lock function. The Phantom's high etch Naza-M autopilot system lets you configure advanced parameters via software USA port and separate download required. 17�new �from�$449.49 11�used �from�$325.00 1�refurbished �from�$399.99 This item will be visible when delivered. Extended distance transmitters usually employ several methods to promote signal strength and reliability. 1 Frequency-hopping spread spectrum fess is a method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly switching between several frequencies to seek the least amount of traffic. 2 Dual or triple paths' diversity enable signals to reach two receivers or antennas mounted in different locations on the quad copter enables the transmission to utilize the strongest signal path. This includes wingspan, flying time, camera, controller, sensors, and skill level. Several improvements were implemented on the MX400 Version 2 that also included additional packaging and quality assurance. Balanced motors substantially reduce vibration, a common cause of poor video quality. GoPro's virtual reality plans are far from complete, but the company has launched a product called Odyssey, a mount with 16 cameras that can be stitched together by Koror to create a virtual reality view. Maybe that's the future of photography and action sports? Or maybe it's a market GoPro will have a tough time entering? GoPro's true legacy GoPro's success with the Hero line of cameras is nothing short of astounding. But the hard part for the company will be turning that success into the next growth opportunity. Maybe that's in software, maybe it's in drones, and maybe it's in virtual reality. I wouldn't put anything past Woodman, who has proven to be an effective CEO, despite his eccentric tendencies. Now he has to prove that he's built a company with innovation in its DNA. That's easier said than done. I found some large abandoned areas near some rail road tracks which provided an amazing view of a local park as well as the canter of town. Having this information will enable you to safely land the MX400 quad copter without guessing how much power is left in the flight battery. �� Slight deviations in traditional circular mounting holes or protruding motor shafts are extremely difficult to detect which magnify pitch and tracking variances, a major cause of vibrations and unstable flights. Depending on individual's hand-eye coordination, you should be ready to transition to conservative flights on larger quad copter in a couple of weeks. Implementations of slotted tracks enable fast and secured transitions without the risk losing any hardware. This is especially useful if a less experienced pilot is rotating the quad copter to pan the video. For those flyers new to the AC scene who are looking to get their feet wet with a basic quad a great option is the husband X4 micro. Without proper C, one or more of the quad copter rotors will constantly strain to maintain balance. As the quad copter takes off there is an initial sign of relief, then comes the bad news.

Human vision under common illumination conditions (not pitch black or blindingly bright) follows an approximate gamma or power function. If images are not gamma encoded, they allocate too many bits or too much bandwidth to highlights that humans cannot differentiate, and too few bits/bandwidth to shadow values that humans are sensitive to and would require more bits/bandwidth to maintain the same visual quality. Gamma encoding of floating point images is not required (and may be counterproductive) because the floating point format already provides a pseudo-logarithmic encoding. A common misconception is that gamma encoding was developed to compensate for the input–output characteristic of cathode ray tube (CRT) displays.. But in fact, the gamma characteristics of the display device do not play a factor in the gamma encoding of images and video—they need gamma encoding to maximize the visual quality of the signal, regardless of the gamma characteristics of the display device. The similarity of CRT physics to the inverse of gamma encoding needed for video transmission was a combination of luck and engineering which simplified the electronics in early television sets..""",2011-10-08 17:38:56,2012-10-09 01:26:19,1,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, evidence supporting the effectiveness of mHealth is scant. We argue this gap between app availability and research evidence is primarily due to unsuitable knowledge translation practices and therefore suggest abandoning the randomised controlled trial as the primary app evaluation paradigm. Alternative evaluation methodologies such as iterative participatory research and single case designs are better aligned with mHealth translational needs. A further challenge to the use of mobile technology in mental health is the dissemination of information about app quality to consumers. Strategies to facilitate successful dissemination of quality resources must consider several factors, such as target audience and context. In practice, structured solutions to inform consumers of evidence-informed apps could range from the development of consumer used tools to app accreditation portals. Consumer enthusiasm for apps represents an opportunity to increase access and support for psychiatric populations. However, adoption of alternative research methodologies and the development of dissemination strategies are vital before this opportunity can be substantially seized.To read the full article, log in using your NHS OpenAthens details",2016-04-27 12:59:31,2016-04-27 12:59:31,1,http://ebmh.bmj.com/content/19/2/33.short?rss=1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joint attention (JA) involves gaze, gesture, and vocal behavior as well as the expression of positive affect such as smiling. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate deficits in JA and affective expression in early childhood, suggesting the need to teach both. We taught children with ASD to shift their gaze and smile in a pattern that mirrors initiating joint attention (IJA). The intervention involved the use of a visual prompt and reinforcement. All children shifted gaze and smiled, showed some generalization and maintenance at 3-month follow-up, and showed changes in the quality of interactions as judged by blind observers. This study extends JA intervention research to address aspects of IJA and the expression of affect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract).

Under the new laws, smoke alarms must be fitted on every floor of the property as well as carbon monoxide alarms in properties which burn solid fuels. Landlords must check the alarms are working at the start of every new tenancy with potential penalties of up to 5,000 if they dont comply. To help landlords gear up for the new regulations the Government has provided Cleveland Fire Brigade with a limited number of free smoke and carbon monoxide alarms to give out to relevant landlords. We are keen to work with local landlords to improve the safety of tenants across our area, said Phil Lancaster, the Brigades Director of Community Protection. We would urge those landlords, who need to take action to comply with the new regulations to visit our website www.clevelandfire.gov.uk/private-landlords , look at the guidance notes and complete the request form if they are eligible for the free smoke alarms and CO Alarms. The number of alarms allocated to us by the Government is limited so we will be dealing with requests from Landlords on a first come first served basis. While deaths and injuries from fires have reduced considerably in recent years, the majority of victims continue to be those who are most vulnerable, often living in private rented accommodation. While overall smoke alarm ownership in the country stands at around 90%, those living in private rented homes are far less likely to have a working smoke alarm. Statistically people are four times more likely to die in a fire in the home if there is no working smoke alarm and over the next 10 years it is estimated that the new laws will result in 231 fewer deaths and 5,860 less injuries. Mr Lancaster continued, We are delighted that the Government has acknowledged that there is still work for the fire service to do to keep people safe in their homes and have brought in these new laws which will improve the safety of families and stop dozens of people from losing their lives to fire each year.

Chief Fire Officer Jon Hall said: ""During this short period of industrial unrest we will be providing an effective and professional fire and rescue service in the county."" ""However, we are also asking business owners to make sure their properties are as safe as they possibly can be in case there is any small delay in our response - now is the time to make absolutely sure they have thought through their own fire safety policies."" Local businesses are being given the following advice: Ensure fire alarms have been tested and are working Keep fire doors closed, with correct signage in place Make sure smoking policies are being rigidly enforced Switch off and unplug any unused electrical equipment where it is safe to do so Ensure refuse and waste is controlled and bins and skips placed away from buildings Supervise closely any work requiring the use of equipment which produces a flame or spark and avoid such work where possible Supervise and manage contract workers closely Make sure that lifts are well maintained and used correctly Meanwhile, residents are being encouraged to take steps to ensure their families are safe at home. Fires can start for a variety of reasons, from cooking being left unattended, to electrical faults or candles being placed too close to furnishings. The best advice is for everyone to ensure they have a smoke alarm in their home and to check the battery is working at least once a week. More than 50 per cent of fires attended by county firefighters start in the kitchen, so people are asked to take particular care when cooking. Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: ""Local businesses and residents can be assured that the county's fire and rescue service is fully prepared for this short period of industrial action.""

Building upon the insights gained to date through the CANHEART work, we have recently launched a new CANHEART SPOR project aimed at leveraging big data to conduct innovative cardiovascular clinical trials. We aim to: 1) undertake a pragmatic cluster randomized registry-based clinical trial to improve lipid-management amongst intermediate-and high-risk patients residing in high-risk health regions in Ontario (called CHOICES), and 2) develop novel algorithms for measuring clinical outcomes in clinical trials using health-related databases and compare whether they are as accurate as traditional event ascertainment methods in a prospective clinical trial (called INVESTED).

[This is an article from The Chronicle of Higher Education, America’s leading higher education publication. It is presented here under an agreement with University World News.] The US secretary for health and human services, Tom Price, told Congress this week that the idea is to save taxpayers money while giving them the same amount of research activity. Indirect cost payments are funds spent on ""something other than the research that’s being done,"" Dr Price told a House of Representatives subcommittee on health appropriations on Wednesday. But university representatives made clear on Thursday that it simply does not work that way. Indirect costs reflect the legitimate expenses of providing scientists with labs and complying with a host of essential services that somehow will still need to be paid, the representatives said. Under current law, a researcher who receives a federal grant to conduct research cannot simply be billed by his or her university for those costs, said Tobin L Smith, vice president for policy at the Association of American Universities, which represents major research institutions. And universities absolutely won't force students to cover the difference, Smith said. ""The reality is we don't have other revenue sources to pay for those things, because let's face it, we are not going to rob tuition to pay for those costs,"" he said. ""It just is not going to happen."" It's not clear what universities would do if Congress actually accepted the administration's proposal to end indirect cost payments, said David Kennedy, director of costing policy and studies at the Council on Governmental Relations, another association of research universities and affiliated medical centres.

They generate reports on the average wait time, count the number of consumers in every queue, and the average number of people waiting in every line. This reporting can help predict the amount of cashiers that are needed to reduce consumer’s wait times[1]. - Queue flow: Sometimes there’s not much a retailer can do to prevent queues. In such situations, retailers focus on speed[2]. - Queue management systems: They help supermarkets reduce the queue and improve employee performance, which attracts more customers. The system can accurately track the idle time of each individual cashier/service agent, the wait time of each customer, and the service delivery/transaction time of each customer. This data can help managers monitor and improve employee performance, which could have a significant impact on service quality and customer satisfaction[3]. Goods Positioning: - Pricing: Pricing plays a vital role in optimization. Retailers can test for pricing strategies that work best for their customers[2]. - Performance metrics: Evaluating how staff impacts store operations and sales is a critical feature of in-store optimization. Retailers use performance metrics to build the schedule and evaluate the stores and employees. For example, service intensity, service level, sales per hour, and service productivity[2]. - Game theory of queuing: Customers choose which queue to join based on their strategy. Retailers can use game-theoretic models for queuing in a supermarket to optimize the queue[6]. Overall, queue optimization and goods positioning are essential for supermarkets to improve customer satisfaction, increase sales, and reduce wait times.",2023-09-26 15:12:55,2023-09-26 15:12:55,1,https://www.perplexity.ai/search/give-me-examples-KofU3HE4RPiLqS9.SR4jnQ?s=c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The need to develop information literacy, the process of finding, retrieving, organizing, and evaluating the ever-expanding collection of online information, has precipitated the need for training in skill-based competencies in higher education, as well as medical and dental education. The current study evaluated the information literacy skills of first-year dental students, consisting of two, consecutive dental student cohorts (n = 160). An assignment designed to evaluate information literacy skills was conducted. In addition, a survey of student online search engine or database preferences was conducted to identify any significant associations. Subsequently, an intervention was developed, based upon the results of the assessment and survey, to address any deficiencies in information literacy. Nearly half of students (n = 70/160 or 43%) missed one or more question components that required finding an evidence-based citation. Analysis of the survey revealed a significantly higher percentage of students who provided incorrect responses (n = 53/70 or 75.7%) reported using Google as their preferred online search method (p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, a significantly higher percentage of students who reported using PubMed (n = 39/45 or 86.7%) were able to provide correct responses (p &lt; 0.01). Following a one-hour intervention by a health science librarian, virtually all students were able to find and retrieve evidence-based materials for subsequent coursework. This study confirmed that information literacy among this student population was lacking and that integration of modules within the curriculum can help students to filter and establish the quality of online information, a critical component in the training of new health care professionals.

The report is based on an online survey completed by over 3400 General Practice Nurses (GPNs) during 2015.
 
The report, ‘General Practice Nursing in the 21st Century: A Time of Opportunity’ summaries some of the key challenges affecting the profession today. It is the largest and most up to date survey of GPNs, and the first carried out by the community nursing charity.
 
Dr Crystal Oldman, QNI Chief Executive commented:
 
‘This survey validates the role of the General Practice Nurse and the support provided by nurses in General Practice at every point during a person’s life, from infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood, to middle and older age. They are a vital part of the healthcare system in every part of the UK.
 
‘The findings of the survey indicate some major challenges and opportunities which need to be addressed. The role of nurses in General Practice is expanding rapidly, and many of today’s nurses are now undertaking roles traditionally the reserve of GPs. There is a huge opportunity for increased investment in the General Practice Nurse workforce, to build the capacity of primary care, move more care to the community and closer to people’s own homes, and ease the pressures on A&E.
 
‘The survey findings will be useful to policy makers and workforce planners as they explore new models of care and meet the challenges of an older population with multiple and complex healthcare needs. The number of nurses planning to retire should be of major concern and we need to ensure that enough nurses are attracted to the profession so that patients can continue to receive high quality nursing care for themselves and their families when they attend the GP’s surgery.’
 
Headline findings of the survey:
 
Workforce
33.4% of General Practice Nurses are due to retire by 2020
Men are under-represented, comprising only 2.0% of the General Practice Nurse workforce
43.1% did not feel their nursing team has the right number of appropriately qualified and trained staff to meet the needs of patients
At the time of the survey, 78.8% had considered preparation for NMC re-validation
 
Education
53.0% reported that their employer always supports their professional development
10.6% hold an NMC recordable specialist practice qualification in General Practice Nursing
32.6% of General Practice Nurses are independent prescribers
Just 27.0% of the employers offered placements for pre-registration nursing students, compared to 61.5% offering placements to medical students
 
Employment
22.8% of nurses working in General Practice have two jobs
32.6% of General Practice Nurses reported working evening sessions (after 6pm) and 18.5% work weekends
Over 38.3% indicated that they undertook visits to patients at home
Only 35% felt that their salary reflected their role within the practice
Salary and other terms and conditions such as annual leave entitlement vary widely
 
The QNI is developing a range of resources to support nurses working in General Practice. On 19 January it will launch a free online learning resource to support nurses who are new to General Practice, ‘Transition to General Practice Nursing’ based on the knowledge and expertise of nurses and educators working in the profession.
 
During 2016 the charity will also work with QNI Scotland to produce new Voluntary Standards for General Practice Nurse Education and Practice, which will enhance the existing Nursing and Midwifery Council specialist practice standards for General Practice Nursing.
 
ENDS
 
Notes:
 
The full report can be downloaded from the QNI’s website at: http://www.qni.org.uk/campaigns/general_practice_nurse_survey
 
The QNI is a charity founded in 1887 and originally trained District Nurses to treat patients in their own homes. Today it offers a wide range of support to all nurses who work in the community, through financial assistance and scholarships, policy, campaigns, events and publications. We believe that high quality nursing should be available for everyone, where and when they need it.

I could just see Eleanor shut the kitchen door and so ran round to the front of the house where she was coming out. Thats when I rang for the fire service and they were there really quickly. I have a friend in the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service and I remembered him telling him me how lethal smoke is in a fire and that you should get out of the house straightaway. Im glad my advice worked and that Eleanor came out OK. The fire started after Mrs Smith moved her old microwave across her kitchen worktop and on to the hob of her electric oven to make space for a replacement microwave. The mini cooker accidentally caught the on dial on the electric oven, which slowly heated the microwave until both ovens caught fire, setting off the smoke alarm on the ground floor. Mrs Smith said: I didnt want my kitchen to get any further damaged so I tried to put the fire out myself. My first thought was to put the flames out and it didnt seem such a difficult thing to do. But the fire was so much bigger than I initially thought. I didnt realise the smoke would be that bad. Im so grateful to Michael for stopping and helping me. He was so good to stop and come to my aid. Firefighters from Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service (TWFRS) wearing breathing apparatus went in to the kitchen and carried the microwave outside before pouring water over the appliance to ensure the fire was fully out. Nicole Mordecai, Watch Manager in Community Safety for Sunderland, said: Our advice if you have a fire is very simple get out of the house immediately, stay out and dial 999.

The first-team players Wenger called upon largely played as if they were scared of following Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott to the treatment room. Losing those two players is undoubtedly a blow for Arsenal, especially because theyre both capable of filling in on the right wing. Wengers preferred choice in that position,Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey, is already out. To suffer three muscular injuries in the same part of the field is definitely unfortunate, and it leaves Wenger facing a difficult decision over how to restructure his attack on Saturday at the Liberty Stadium.

There were high hopes for the likes of Alex Iwobi, who has already been capped by the Nigeria senior team, but no one delivered a performance that suggested they were ready for first-team inclusion. The reality is that the most promising young talents at Arsenalthe likes of Gedion Zelalem, Isaac Hayden and Chuba Akpomare out on loan. In fact, Akpom and Hayden both featured for their temporary club Hull City last night as they progressed to the next round by beating Leicester City. Overall, Arsenal gave the impression of a team who couldnt wait to be out of this competition. The sense prevails that the club feel they have bigger fish to fry. With Chelsea floundering, the Gunners appear to be the only real competition for the Manchester clubs in the fight for Premier League superiority. That wont be much consolation to the Arsenal fans who travelled to Sheffield to watch such a poor performance.

Maria Boon, head of prevention at Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""We are delighted that so many schools and community groups across the county have taken up the opportunity to learn our vital safety lessons."" ""Young peoples safety is at the heart of what we do and SkillZONE is the perfect environment in which to teach it. We will continue to reach out to groups that might benefit from touring the centre - it could be a lifesaver."" Adam Hanwell, 11, toured the facility with Crudwell Cub Scouts. His dad Tom Hanwell said the visit was particularly eye-opening because they had recently had a fire at home. Tom said: ""We came home to 6ft flames coming out of the chimney and all the emergency services were there. It was completely alien to my son and he couldn't understand it."" At the end of the SkillZONE tour he had a much better idea of what firefighters and emergency services do. It taught him exactly what to do if he was ever in a similar situation. Our scouts valued the trip so much we will definitely come again. The centre has also been used for a wide range of community events including Older Peoples Month, Black History Month, Child Accident Prevention Week and for safety courses for young mums. Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: ""In the past year, we've had countless classes and community groups come through the doors of SkillZONE and nothing but positive feedback."" ""Many who have visited are already looking to return and I hope the centre will continue to go from strength to strength."" Anyone who would like to know more or book a two hour tour should visit http://skillzone.glosfire.gov.uk/ or put a date in their diary to attend a SkillZONE open day on Saturday July 19th.

So from December, European regulations will limit the maximum concentration of PAH in any rubber or plastic component which comes into contact with the skin or oral cavity. Intertek experts have been preparing clients for some time for these tighter regulations which will affect products such as watch straps, costumes, utensils, bags, stationery, sports equipment, clothing, footwear, and gloves, where the maximum concentration will be 1 part PAH per million. The new regulations have even tighter regulations for toys and childcare articles with a lower maximum PAH of 0.5mg/kg. Dr David Elks, Technical Manager said, We have been working with our manufacturer and retailer partners for some time to prepare for these changes and the additional scrutiny that will follow. This is important because if a product is found to be non-compliant, not only can it be withdrawn from the market, but it can result in heavy fines and possible criminal prosecution. Retail Services Director UK & Eire Christine Smith said, Interteks global expertise in product testing, inspecting and certifying, enables us to work in partnership with our clients to enable them to stay ahead of changes in legislation and be prepared in advance.

Andrew Bright of Cleveland Fire Brigade, said: The Fire Brigade is often first at the scene when a road traffic collision occurs so we know all about the carnage that can result and the devastating impact it can have on families. Driving a heavy goods vehicle clearly brings added responsibilities and if something goes wrong the consequences can have fatal implications. During the training sessions we have been focussing on what we call the Fatal Four which are responsible for a large proportion of traffic collisions. These are speed, distracted driving such as using a mobile phone, alcohol & drugs, and seat belt compliance. In addition the dangers of driver fatigue were also covered. Employers have a responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work Act to ensure that others are not put at risk by work-related activities and that includes driving. Companies such as Bertschi UK Ltd are to be commended for their commitment to their professional staff training programmes to maintain and improve driver safety.

Maggie Hassan really backpedaling in her position on Syrian refugees, as her Republican critics insist? Well let you be the judge. On Monday, Hassans spokesman issued a statement saying in part: (T)he Governor believes that the federal government should halt acceptance of refugees from Syria until intelligence and defense officials can assure that the process for vetting all refugees, including those from Syria, is as strong as possible to ensure the safety of the American people. On Wednesday, Hassan wrote in an opinion piece in the New Hampshire Union Leader: I have called for the federal government to temporarily halt acceptance of refugees from Syria until intelligence and defense officials can assure that the process for vetting all refugees is as strong as possible to ensure public safety. This should be a temporary measure. The federal government can and must work in a timely fashion to conduct a thorough re-evaluation of every step in the screening process, including ensuring proper resources for departments responsible for carrying out these screenings. Hassan was on a conference call hosted by the White House on Tuesday night that included 33 other governors, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and officials of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, the State Department and the FBI. According to a White House statement, the federal officials briefed the governors on the rigorous screening and security vetting process that is required before a refugee is able to travel to the United States. Hassan spokesman William Hinkle said that during the call: Gov. Hassan specifically emphasized that the federal government is not doing enough to communicate with state and local public safety officials about who is being resettled, what their backgrounds are, and how they have been screened.

The latest uproar over Trump's behavior on the campaign trail was ignited by remarks the billionaire real-estate tycoon and former reality-TV star made during a South Carolina rally on Tuesday about the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York's World Trade Center. Trump, front-runner for his party's nomination for the November, 2016 election, was defending his unsubstantiated assertions that thousands of Muslims were seen in New Jersey cheering the collapse of the Twin Towers. During the speech, he singled out Times investigative reporter Serge Kovaleski for a story he wrote a few days after the attacks while he was then a Washington Post correspondent. That article reported authorities had detained ""a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river."" Those accounts have never been authenticated. Kovaleski himself said in a recent CNN interview that he did ""not recall anyone saying there were thousands, or even hundreds of people celebrating. That was not the case, as best I can remember."" While not referring to Kovaleski by name in his speech, Trump accused the reporter of backing down from his own story. ""Now, the poor guy - you've got to see this guy. 'Ah, I don't know what I said. I don't remember,'"" Trump said at the microphone, jerking his arms in front of his body and slurring his words in a crude impression of the reporter. Kovaleski suffers from a congenital condition called arthrogryposis, which limits mobility and muscle development in the joints. The New York Times issued a statement on Thursday rebuking Trump, saying, ""We think it's outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters."" Trump fired back on social media, denying he had made fun of Kovaleski's disability or would even recognize him. ""I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago,"" Trump wrote.

Click on the link for further information on fire door accessories. You will also find a huge selection of modern, stylish fire doors which are all available at great, online prices This highlights the need to increase skills and confidence across the region, to give every person the best chance of survival. A survey of adults in the North West by the BHF revealed that just 44% know CPR. Just 36% of adults in the North West would be confident of performing immediate CPR if someone collapsed in front of them 61% of people would be worried about knowing what to do if someone collapsed with a cardiac arrest in front of them 64% of those who were worried said they feared making things worse by trying to help 45% of those who were worried admitted they would feel helpless Only 20% of people were able to correctly identify the signs2 that someone has had a cardiac arrest Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive at the British Heart Foundation, said: Survival rates for cardiac arrest are critically low in the North West and far too many lives are lost needlessly because not enough people have the skills and confidence to carry out lifesaving CPR. Sadly, you are most likely to witness a cardiac arrest at home, which is why its so important that more people are trained and are able to act in that situation. Performing CPR in those vital immediate minutes after a cardiac arrest can, in some cases, double a persons chance of survival. This unique partnership between three lifesaving organisations will give everyone across Manchester easy access to learn how to help save a life and create a Nation of Lifesavers. Following todays events, the CPR kits provided to GMFRS by the BHF will also be used on fire stations to train other community groups. NWAS Community Engagement Manager, Andrew Redgrave said: Earlier this year we launched our Cardiac Smart campaign to have the installation of AEDs in public places a legal requirement, in the same way that fire extinguishers are. Those who suffer a cardiac arrest will receive treatment when the ambulance crew arrives but if a member of the public can start that process while help is on the way, it can make a huge difference to their chances of survival. To help BHF create a Nation of Lifesavers please visit www.bhf.org.uk/lifesavers Notes to Editor All survey figures, unless stated otherwise, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 402 adults.

Therefore, people are being asked to take a picture of themselves next to a defib and to tweet it with the hashtag #findthedefib and their location, in the hope it will raise awareness and help save lives. GMFRS' County Fire Officer Peter OReilly is leading by example (see picture above) and has tweeted his selfie. Peter took his selfie next to the defibrillator at GMFRS' headquarters it is situated to the left of reception after you enter the main part of the building. AEDs are small machines which can shock a persons heart into restarting and if this can be done in the vital first few minutes, patients have a 60-70 per cent chance of making a full recovery. They are easy to use, easy to carry and they talk people through the process, which means they wont deliver a shock unless it is required. There is no clinical training required to be able to use the machine. So if you are out and about and see a defib, please join in the campaign and tweet a picture. CFO O'Reilly's tweet A spokesperson for NWAS said: Forgotten, lonely, gathering dust and tucked away in a corner thats the sad fate of many life-saving defibrillators which have been installed with good intentions by well-meaning members of the public, business owners and clubs. Now its time to find the defib and make sure every single one in the region is logged on North West Ambulance Services database so they can be used to save a life. GMFRS' CFO Peter OReilly added: We are happy to support our colleagues at NWAS with this campaign, as we fully appreciate the importance of defibrillators in saving lives. Many of our staff are already familiar in how to use them and as we assist our NWAS colleagues in responding to cardiac arrests it is right we help to highlight where defibrillators are situated so more lives can be saved in our communities.

However, on-loan Nottingham Forest striker Nelson Oliveira insists the Euros campaign starts now for a Portugal team who have won nine of their last 11 games. The 24-year-old told A Bola: ""The Euros begin now for us and these are games that we can use to prepare us better for the competition. ""We intend to produce good matches and win, because we always want to win.The coach was watching several other players and I was one of them. ""I wanted to be called and was in a good moment for my club. I worked hard to be here and the coach thought I deserved to be called, so I am grateful for that."" Nice defender Ricardo Pereira has earned his first international call-up and feels the absence of many of the squad's senior players provides others with avital opportunity to stake their claims. ""Of course I hope to be at the Euros, everyone anticipates the decision even those who did not make this squad,"" he said. ""These two games are important for those who have fewer opportunities to show their value to the coach and help the team. We do have the quality to win the Euros but we have to show it on the pitch."" Russia are also on a high after Leonid Slutsky masterminded a late recovery in their qualifying campaign after replacing Fabio Capello at the helm. Four straight wins saw them surge into second place and condemn Sweden to the play-offs, with defender Andrei Semyonov making it clear that their games against Portugal and Croatia will be taken seriously. ""Playing for the national team there is always a big responsibility,"" he said. ""We are all preparing for the friendly match as if it is an official game. It is as important as ever to do that because we face very serious opponents in Portugal and Croatia. ""We would like to play against the key players but in principle, Portugal have someone to replace each of their leaders. I would have liked Ronaldo to play, as it would have been interesting to face him.

The main advantages of the new system are: It determines which appliances are closest to an incident and recommends mobilisations to the operator. Comprehensive mapping is integral to the system. It provides the flexibility to allow us to configure it fully to meet future demands. It is able to integrate with other GFRS IT systems. It automatically presents the operators with a call history or any relevant operational intelligence linked to any address when a call is received. ENDS Notes to Editors The 1.8m grant was received from the DCLG last year to upgrade fire control and the mobilising system. In addition to the new control room and mobilising system: The mobilising equipment has been updated at every county fire station. This is the equipment that receives the signal from the control room, alerts fire crews and prints callout details. Generator power protection at six main stations has been installed so they can be used as resilience hubs for the service and its partners.

The Service first entered the Index in 2010 and was placed 303rd out of 350 organisations, with 2011 seeing an improvement to 253rd out of 370. The last three years, however, has seen the Service placed just outside of the top 100. Deputy Chief Fire Officer and Strategic Lead on Equality and LGBT Issues, Wayne Bowcock said: This is a huge achievement for the Service. We have been working really hard to improve understanding and awareness of LGBT issues across the Service both in terms of employment and the way in which we engage with communities. ""We work in partnership with local agencies and the unions in order to improve our performance in this area of work and it is paying off. Id like to thank them for their effort and enthusiasm in helping us to promote LGBT equality. Chair of the Fire Authority, Cllr Darrell Pulk, added: I am delighted with this recognition by Stonewall of our commitment to promoting equality for all employees. This achievement has been brought about by a lot of hard work and dedication by members of the Service, and all those involved can feel proud that Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service is amongst the top organisations nationally in this area, and is truly representative of the people it serves. My congratulations go to all concerned with reaching this milestone. The Service was required to give Stonewall clear evidence of how it provides a safe and inclusive environment and how it supports LGBT staff. Simon Feeke, Stonewall Director of Workplace Programmes, said: Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service and every single employer who secured a position on the Stonewall Top 100 Employers 2015 list performed remarkably this year.

Thymiatis won in the BSc/MSc category. Natalie Chiu, who studies food science at the University of Nottingham in the UK, won in the PhD category. ""I was always interested in cooking and baking,"" said Chiu. ""During school we were taught a module of food chemistry and my interest in the interaction between ingredients grew from there. As my passion for the science of food expanded, I wanted to study food science at university."" Young scientists, advanced thinking According to Chiu, her research project explored a novel method of lowering levels of sodium through entrapping and subsequent release during consumption via breakdown of the starch emulsifier. ""This research may offer the food industry new avenues to formulate food products that are healthier for consumers,"" she said, adding that her dream is to create a food start-up to redesign and reinvent foods for a healthier future. Thymiatis's research project entailed developing a process to valorize grape pomace, the main solid waste of the wine-making industry. ""The aim of the process was to create an extract of phenolic compounds to transform this waste into a valuable by-product,"" he said. ""Phenolic compounds can have significant applications in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries."" Thymiatis explained that he applied for the award to draw attention to the problem of waste management in the food industry and transform it into a potential solution that benefits both businesses and society.

We will continue to reach out to groups that might benefit from touring the centre - it could be a lifesaver."" Adam Hanwell, 11, toured the facility with Crudwell Cub Scouts. His dad Tom Hanwell said the visit was particularly eye-opening because they had recently had a fire at home. Tom said: ""We came home to 6ft flames coming out of the chimney and all the emergency services were there. It was completely alien to my son and he couldn't understand it."" At the end of the SkillZONE tour he had a much better idea of what firefighters and emergency services do. It taught him exactly what to do if he was ever in a similar situation.

One of the areas high on the agenda is making sure that back lanes throughout the city are clear of bulky waste and rubbish bags that could be used to create illegal bonfires. People are being urged to dispose of their items in residential refuse bins or at one of the three approved recycling centres at Byker, Brunswick and Walbottle. For further details please visit www.newcastle.gov.uk/environment-and-waste Councillor Nick Kemp, Chair of Safe Newcastle, said: As the dark nights draw in and we get close to bonfire night, we really must look to make sure that we keep an eye on the fly tipping and general rubbish being left in back lanes. We know from experience that the rubbish dumped is often used for unofficial bonfires which can lead to all kinds of problems, from safety of the people involved but also damage to property and of worry to elderly residents. Our enforcement officers will be out monitoring the streets and back lanes to look to prevent bulky items being dumped and left and to prevent people collecting rubbish for unofficial fires. The City holds a number of official organised bon fires and we encourage people to attend these events. We would like to stress that the Council will prosecute those individuals or businesses who break the law and choose to ignore warnings and littering and fly tipping. All year round the Council operates the Keep it Clean campaign that is aimed at encouraging behavioural change amongst people who litter, fly-tip and dont pick up after their pets in Newcastle. It is hoped this campaign will help to stamp out a problem that has a knock-on effect across the city. Also, Your Homes Newcastle, the arms-length management organisation responsible for managing the citys council housing will be organising 34 clean-up events over a two week starting from Tuesday 20th October. This will give residents the chance to clear out any rubbish from their gardens before Bonfire Night. During the events, skips will be delivered to estates across the city and Your Homes Newcastle staff will be out-and-about helping people to make use of the temporary resources. Quite often rubbish left in residents gardens can be set alight or used on illegal bonfires so people are being encouraged to take this opportunity to have a clean-up and help keep their estates safe and tidy. A list containing all of the dates and times of the community clean-up events are available at www.yhn.org.uk/events.aspx . The Darker Nights programme looks to point people in the direction of official firework displays and bonfire events that are being organised by licensed and fully trained operators.

by information processing, and relates this strange idea to the findings of
modern physics about the physical world. The virtual reality concept is
familiar to us from online worlds, but our world as a virtual reality is
usually a subject for science fiction rather than science. Yet logically the
world could be an information simulation running on a multi-dimensional
space-time screen. Indeed, if the essence of the universe is information,
matter, charge, energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the
many conservation laws could be a single law of information conservation. If
the universe were a virtual reality, its creation at the big bang would no
longer be paradoxical, as every virtual system must be booted up. It is
suggested that whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual reality
is a matter for science to resolve. Modern information science can suggest how
core physical properties like space, time, light, matter and movement could
derive from information processing. Such an approach could reconcile relativity
and quantum theories, with the former being how information processing creates
space-time, and the latter how it creates energy and matter.",,,whitworth2008physical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 12 experts, six residents, and nine novices. After orientation, participants were asked to perform a modified radical mastoidectomy on the simulator. Comparisons of time taken, injury to structures, and forces exerted were made between the groups to determine which specific metrics would discriminate experience levels.Experts completed the simulated task in significantly shorter time than the other two groups (experts 22 minutes, residents 36 minutes, and novices 46 minutes; P = 0.001). Novices exerted significantly higher average forces when dissecting close to vital structures compared with experts (0.24 Newton N vs 0.13 N, P = 0.002). Novices were also more likely to injure structures such as dura compared to experts (23 injuries vs 3 injuries, P = 0.001). Compared with residents, the experts modulated their force between initial cortex dissection and dissection close to vital structures. Using the combination of these metrics, we were able to correctly classify the participants' level of experience 90 percent of the time.This preliminary study shows that measurements of performance obtained from within a virtual reality simulator can differentiate between levels of users' experience.

Each rule specifies a nonverbal behavior category: posture, head movement, facial expression and gaze direction as well as three parameters: type, frequency and proportion. In a first user-study, we asked participants to pretend to be a speaker in VR and then create sets of nonverbal behaviour parameters to simulate different attitudes. Participants manipulated the nonverbal behaviours of single virtual spectator to match a specific levels of engagement and opinion toward them. In a second user-study, we used these parameters to design different types of virtual audiences with our nonverbal behavior rules and evaluated their perceptions.

This is time consuming, costly, and of variable effectiveness. Training using a virtual reality simulator is an option to supplement standard training.To determine whether virtual reality training can supplement or replace conventional laparoscopic surgical training (apprenticeship) in surgical trainees with limited or no prior laparoscopic experience.We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and grey literature until March 2008.We included all randomised clinical trials comparing virtual reality training versus other forms of training including video trainer training, no training, or standard laparoscopic training in surgical trainees with little or no prior laparoscopic experience. We also included trials comparing different methods of virtual reality training.We collected the data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality of the trials, mortality, morbidity, conversion rate, operating time, and hospital stay. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis.We included 23 trials with 612 participants. Four trials compared virtual reality versus video trainer training. Twelve trials compared virtual reality versus no training or standard laparoscopic training. Four trials compared virtual reality, video trainer training and no training, or standard laparoscopic training. Three trials compared different methods of virtual reality training. Most of the trials were of high risk of bias. In trainees without prior surgical experience, virtual reality training decreased the time taken to complete a task, increased accuracy, and decreased errors compared with no training; virtual reality group was more accurate than video trainer training group. In the participants with limited laparoscopic experience, virtual reality training reduces operating time and error better than standard in the laparoscopic training group; composite operative performance score was better in the virtual reality group than in the video trainer group.Virtual reality training can supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training of apprenticeship and is at least as effective as video trainer training in supplementing standard laparoscopic training.

In the case of the honeybee Apis mellifera, this possibility may fill the gap between behavioural analyses in free-flight and cellular analyses in the laboratory. Using automated, computer-controlled systems, it is possible to generate virtual stimuli or even entire environments that can be modified to test hypotheses on bee visual behaviour. The bee itself can remain tethered in place, making it possible to record neural activity while the bees is performing behavioural tasks. Recent studies have examined visual navigation and attentional processes in VR on flying or walking tethered bees, but experimental paradigms for examining visual learning and memory are only just emerging. Behavioural performances of bees under current experimental conditions are often lower in VR than in natural environments, but further improvements on current experimental protocols seem possible. Here we discuss current developments and conclude that it is essential to tailor the specifications of the VR simulation to the visual processing of honeybees to improve the success of this research endeavour.",,,SCHULTHEISS201743,Current Opinion in Insect Science,2214-5745,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2017.08.003,,,24,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are interested in creating pedagogical narratives: narratives encompass affective phenomena and rather than organizing events changing the course of a training scenario, pedagogical plans using our system focus on organizing the affects it arouses for the trainees.
Efficiently controlling a virtual audience towards a specific training objective while evaluating the speaker's performance presents a challenge for a seminar instructor: the high level of cognitive and physical demands required to be able to control the virtual audience, whilst evaluating speaker's performance, adjusting and allowing it to quickly react to the user’s behaviors and interactions. It is indeed a critical limitation of a number of existing systems that they rely on a Wizard of Oz approach, where the tutor drives the audience in reaction to the user’s performance. We address this problem by integrating with a VAS a high-level control component for tutors, which allows using predefined audience behavior rules, defining custom ones, as well as intervening during run-time for finer control of the unfolding of the pedagogical plan. At its core, this component offers a tool to program, select, modify and monitor interactive training narratives using a high-level representation. 
The STAGE offers the following features: i) a high-level API to program pedagogical narratives focusing on a specific public speaking situation and training objectives, ii) an interactive visualization interface iii) computation and visualization of user metrics, iv) a semi-autonomous virtual audience composed of virtual spectators with automatic reactions to the speaker and surrounding spectators while following the pedagogical plan V) and the possibility for the instructor to embody a virtual spectator to ask questions or guide the speaker from within the Virtual Environment. We present here the design, implementation of the tutoring system and its integration in STAGE, and discuss its reception by end-users.",,,glemarec2022controlling,Frontiers in Virtual Reality – Virtual Reality and Human Behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

differs from the real world. For example, previous work
has shown that users tend to underestimate travel distances in immersive
virtual environments (VEs). As a solution to this problem,
some researchers propose to scale the mapped virtual camera
motion relative to the tracked real-world movement of a user until
real and virtual motion appear to match. In such a way, real-world
movements could be mapped with a larger gain to the VE in order
to compensate for the underestimation. Although this approach
usually results in more accurate self-motion judgments by users,
introducing discrepancies between real and virtual motion can become
a problem, in particular, due to misalignments of both worlds
and distorted space cognition.
In this paper we describe a different approach that introduces apparent
self-motion illusions by manipulating optic flow fields during
movements in VEs. These manipulations can affect self-motion
perception in VEs, but omit a quantitative discrepancy between real
and virtual motions. We introduce four illusions and show in experiments
that optic flow manipulation can significantly affect users’
self-motion judgments. Furthermore, we show that with such manipulation
of optic flow fields the underestimation of travel distances

These surgical tasks were chosen as key steps in mastoid dissection because they were of intermediate complexity. Videos of virtual dissections were captured at baseline and again after practicing each task four to six times.OSATS scores for the tegmen task increased from 2.125 � 1.25 to 3.1 � 0.85 (P = .026), whereas for the sigmoid task scores increased from 2 � 0.45 to 2.75 � 1.125 (P = .0098). The time to complete the tasks decreased from 8.37 � 4.78 minutes to 5.39 � 3.06 minutes (P = .018) for the tegmen task and from 8.99 � 6.7 minutes to 8.68 � 5.98 minutes (P = .594) for the sigmoid task. There was a decline in number of injuries from 0.5 � 1.5 to 0 � 0.5 (P = .594) for the tegmen task and from 2.5 � 4 to 0.5 � 1 (P = .029) for the sigmoid task.Technical skills in mastoidectomy surgery can be acquired during even brief practice on the VR temporal bone simulator. It is anticipated that longer periods of practice presented within the fundamentals of comprehensive curriculum will facilitate procedural learning.

The first objective was to implement real-time soft-tissue deformation and cutting into a virtual reality myringotomy simulator. The second objective was to test the various implemented incision algorithms to determine which most accurately represents the tympanic membrane during myringotomy.Descriptive and face-validity testing.A deformable tympanic membrane was developed, and three soft-tissue cutting algorithms were successfully implemented into the virtual reality myringotomy simulator. The algorithms included element removal, direction prediction, and Delaunay cutting. The simulator was stable and capable of running in real time on inexpensive hardware. A face-validity study was then carried out using a validated questionnaire given to eight otolaryngologists and four senior otolaryngology residents. Each participant was given an adaptation period on the simulator, was blinded to the algorithm being used, and was presented the three algorithms in a randomized order.A virtual reality myringotomy simulator with real-time soft-tissue deformation and cutting was successfully developed. The simulator was stable, ran in real time on inexpensive hardware, and incorporated haptic feedback and stereoscopic vision. The Delaunay cutting algorithm was found to be the most realistic algorithm representing the incision during myringotomy (P < .05). The Likert and visual analog scales had strong correlations, suggesting good internal reliability.The first virtual reality myringotomy simulator is being developed and now integrates a real-time deformable tympanic membrane that appears to have face validity.

Traditionally those photographs were acquired using airplanes or satellites, and later manually processed in order to generate a virtual environment. Recently, Miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs) equipped with digital cameras have been proposed as inexpensive and more flexible alternative to acquire aerial images. The industrial research project Avionic Digital Service Platform (AVIGLE) explores novel approaches to remote sensing by using a swarm of MUAVs, which are equipped with different sensing and network technologies. The acquired data will be sent in quasi-real time to a flight ground control station, where a virtual environment will be generated automatically. While this approach has the potential to provide an efficient alternative to the traditional remote sensing processes, it opens up numerous research and engineering challenges.
In this paper we describe a virtual reality-based simulation framework, which has been developed in the scope of the AVIGLE project. Since the project involves a lot of risks, the simulation of the entire system in a VR-based environment is essential to create a controlled virtual environment that is independent of hardware, flight permissions and influences like weather and lighting conditions. During the project the use of VR is not limited to presentation purposes, but also serves as testbed to simulate and evaluate different hardware setups and software algorithms.",,,SSFRHVDM10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The task involved identification and delineation of the sigmoid sinus in a virtual left-sided temporal bone.Objective data were produced using a scoring matrix incorporated into the VOXEL MAN TempoSurg software. The simulator measured the total time taken to complete the task, the volume and efficiency of bone removal and error data for excessive force or injury to the facial nerve, dura, and sigmoid sinus.Experts and intermediates outperformed novices with respect to the total time taken to complete the task (expert versus novice: p < 0.001; intermediate versus novice: p < 0.001), total volume of bone removed (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03), efficiency of bone removal (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001), time spent with the drill tip obscured (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001), and number of injuries to the sigmoid sinus (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The intermediate group injured the sigmoid sinus on more occasions than the experts (p = 0.008) and were less efficient than experienced surgeons (p = 0.005).Simulator-generated objective metrics can be used to differentiate individuals of differing levels of experience using a standardized temporal bone task.

When developing VR applications, developers should be able to focus on modeling advanced interaction and system behavior instead of rendering issues. Many systems and tools for developing virtual reality applications have been proposed to achieve this goal. However, no de facto standard is available. In this paper we present Virtual Reality VRS (VR2S), a generic VR software system, which is an extension of the high-level rendering system VRS. The system provides flexibility in terms of the rendering system and the user interface toolkit. Thus, with using VR2SÂ  rendering can be performed with several low-level rendering APIs such as OpenGL, RenderMan or ray-tracing systems, and the interface can be implemented by arbitrary user interface toolkits to support both desktop- and VR-based interaction. The proposed system meets the demands of VR developers as well as users and has demonstrated its potential in different planning and exploration applications.",,,SRH05c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The simulation environment presented participants with structured training tasks, which were accompanied by real-time computer-generated feedback as well as real operative videos and photos. After the training, trainees were asked to perform a cortical mastoidectomy on a cadaveric temporal bone. The dissection was videotaped and assessed by 3 otologists blinded to participants' teaching group.The overall performance scores of the simulator-based training group were significantly higher than those of the traditional training group (67% vs 29%; P < .001), with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93, indicating excellent interrater reliability.

Expert reviewers were asked to assess operative readiness of the trainee based on a blind video review of their performance. Computerized hand motion analysis of each participant's performance was conducted.Expert raters were able to discriminate novices from experienced trainees (P < .05) on cadaveric temporal bones, and there was a trend toward discrimination on VR TB performance. Hand motion analysis showed that experienced trainees had better movement economy than novices (P < .05) on the VR TB.Performance, as measured by hand motion analysis on the VR TB simulator, reflects trainees' previous drilling experience.

In addition, specific hardware devices of Virtual Reality (VR) often ship with built-in sensors, i.e. eye-tracking and movements sensors. Hence, the combination of physiological measurements and VR applications seems promising. Several approaches have investigated the applicability and benefits of this combination for various fields of applications. However, the range of possible application fields, coupled with potentially useful and beneficial physiological parameters, types of sensor, target variables and factors, and analysis approaches and techniques is manifold. This article provides a systematic overview and an extensive state-of-the-art review of the usage of physiological measurements in VR. We identified 1,119 works that make use of physiological measurements in VR. Within these, we identified 32 approaches that focus on the classification of characteristics of experience, common in VR applications. The first part of this review categorizes the 1,119 works by field of application, i.e. therapy, training, entertainment, and communication and interaction, as well as by the specific target factors and variables measured by the physiological parameters. An additional category summarizes general VR approaches applicable to all specific fields of application since they target typical VR qualities. In the second part of this review, we analyze the target factors and variables regarding the respective methods used for an automatic analysis and, potentially, classification. For example, we highlight which measurement setups have been proven to be sensitive enough to distinguish different levels of arousal, valence, anxiety, stress, or cognitive workload in the virtual realm. This work may prove useful for all researchers wanting to use physiological data in VR and who want to have a good overview of prior approaches taken, their benefits and potential drawbacks.",,,10.3389/frvir.2021.694567,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,2673-4192,10.3389/frvir.2021.694567,,,2,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To tackle this challenging issue, we conducted an experiment wherein participants learned an immersive virtual environment using a joystick. The following day, participants' brain activity was monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging while they mentally estimated distances in this environment. Results were compared with that of participants performing the same task but having learned the real version of the environment by actual walking. We detected a large set of areas shared by both groups including the parieto-frontal areas and the parahippocampal gyrus. More importantly, although participants of both groups performed the same mental task and exhibited similar behavioral performances, they differed at the brain activity level. Unlike real learners, virtual learners activated a left-lateralized network associated with tool manipulation and action semantics. This demonstrated that a neural fingerprint distinguishing virtual from real learning persists when subjects use a mental representation of the learnt environment with equivalent performances.",,,wiley2009,Human Brain Mapping,,10.1002/hbm.20917,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen children aged 8--13 years comprised the study group. Children attended eight one-hour virtual reality play sessions in which they were immersed and interacted with virtual reality. The Test of Playfulness (TOP) was used as the measure to assess playfulness. Participants were videotaped while they played during 12 different environments over the course of their intervention time. Three randomly selected virtual reality play sessions were chosen to score three different virtual reality environments within each session yielding a total of nine trials (environments) for each participant. The types of virtual environments varied across participants. Overall, the different virtual reality play environments produced varying levels of playfulness according to the TOP's four different subscale scores. Motivation ranged from 1.50 to 2.25, internal control ranged from 1.00 to 1.88, suspension of reality ranged from 0 to 0.26, and framing ranged from 1.33 to 1.78. The three environments producing the highest playfulness ratings were called Paint, Trip and Island Sounds. These environments allowed creativity, persistence with the task, pleasure, and a certain degree of control. Two environments did not appear to foster playfulness. A possible reason was that these environments were too unpredictable and frustrating for participants. These results will be useful for creating new virtual reality software applications that will encourage playfulness in children with disabilities",,,citeulike:892894,Occupational Therapy International,,,,,11,,3,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,2,892894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to distance-related biases such as the distance compression effect or a reduced relative rendering resolution, the self-observation distance (SOD) between the user and the virtual mirror might influence how users perceive their embodied avatar. Our article systematically investigates the effects of a short (1 meter), middle (2.5 meter), and far (4 meter) SOD between user and mirror on the perception of personalized and self-embodied avatars. The avatars were photorealistic reconstructed using state-of-the-art photogrammetric methods. Thirty participants were repeatedly exposed to their real-time animated self-embodied avatars in each of the three SOD conditions. In each condition, the personalized avatars were repeatedly altered in their body weight, and participants were asked to judge the (1) sense of embodiment, (2) body weight perception, and (3) affective appraisal towards their avatar. We found that the different SODs are unlikely to influence any of our measures except for the perceived body weight estimation difficulty. Here, the participants judged the difficulty significantly higher for the farthest SOD. We further found that the participants' self-esteem significantly impacted their ability to modify their avatar's body weight to their current body weight and that it positively correlated with the perceived attractiveness of the avatar. Additionally, the participants' concerns about their body shape affected how eerie they perceived their avatars. Both measures influenced the perceived body weight estimation difficulty. For practical application, we conclude that the virtual mirror in embodiment scenarios can be freely placed and varied at a distance of one to four meters from the user without expecting major effects on the perception of the avatar.",,,wolf2022distance,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,,10.3389/frvir.2022.1031093,,,3,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The principal factors responsible for this phenomenon have remained largely unknown. However, recent experiments suggest that when the virtual environment (VE) is an exact replica of a user's real physical surroundings, the person's distance perception improves. Furthermore, it has been shown that when users start their virtual reality (VR) experience in such a virtual replica and then gradually transition to a different VE, their sense of presence in the actual virtual world increases significantly. In this case the virtual replica serves as a transitional environment between the real and virtual world. In this paper we examine whether a person's distance estimation skills can be transferred from a transitional environment to a different VE. We have conducted blind walking experiments to analyze if starting the VR experience in a transitional environment can improve a person's ability to estimate distances in an immersive VR system. We found that users significantly improve their distance estimation skills when they enter the virtual world via a transitional environment.",,,SBRHLI09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, rendering scenarios that do not interfere with such goals and deplete user experience is becoming progressively more relevant. We present a physiologically-adaptive system that optimizes the virtual environment based on physiological arousal, i.e., electrodermal activity. We investigated the usability of the adaptive system in a simulated social virtual reality scenario. Participants completed an n-back task (primary) and a visual detection (secondary) task. Here, we adapted the visual complexity of the secondary task in the form of the number of not-playable characters of the secondary task to accomplish the primary task. We show that an adaptive virtual reality can improve users’ comfort by adapting to physiological arousal the task complexity. Our findings suggest that physiologically-adaptive virtual reality systems can improve users’ experience in a wide range of scenarios.",,,chiossi2022virtual,Big Data and Cognitive Computing,,10.3390/bdcc6020055,,,6,,2,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-2820,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular multi-touch interaction has proven its usability for 2D tasks, but the challenges to exploit these technologies in virtual reality (VR) setups have rarely been studied. In this paper we address the challenge to allow users to interact with stereoscopically displayed virtual environments when the input is constrained to a 2D touch surface. During interaction with a large-scale touch display a user changes between three different states: (1) beyond the arm-reach distance from the surface, (2) at arm-reach distance and (3) interaction. We have analyzed the user’s ability to discriminate stereoscopic display parallaxes while she moves through these states, i. e., if objects can be imperceptibly shifted onto the interactive surface and become accessible for natural touch interaction. Our results show that the detection thresholds for such manipulations are related to both user motion and stereoscopic parallax, and that users have problems to discriminate whether they touched an object or not, when tangible feedback is expected.",,,VSBHSDK10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such AS displays allow to view stereoscopic content without requiring special glasses. Unfortunately, until now simultaneous monoscopic and stereoscopic display was not possible. Hence prior work on fish tank VR systems focussed either on 2D or 3D interactions. In this paper we introduce so called interscopic interaction concepts providing an improved working experience, which enable great potentials in terms of the interaction between 2D elements, which may be displayed either in monoscopic or stereoscopic, e.g., GUI items, and the 3D virtual environment usually displayed stereoscopically. We present a framework which is based on a software layer between the operating system and its graphical user interface supporting the display of both mono- as well as stereoscopic content in arbitrary regions of an autostereoscopic display. The proposed concepts open up new vistas for the interaction in environments where essential parts of the GUI are displayed monoscopically and other parts are rendered stereoscopically. We address some essential issues of such fish tank VR systems and introduce intuitive interaction concepts which we have realized.",,,SRBH07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the bridge between the quantitative content of the data and human intuition, and thus an essential component of the scientific path from data into knowledge and understanding. Visualization is also essential in the data mining process, directing the choice of the applicable algorithms, and in helping to identify and remove bad data from the analysis. However, a high complexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical obstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may exist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can perceive and interact with multidimensional information poses some deep questions in the field of cognition technology and human-computer interaction. To this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms for scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity hardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi-dimensional data visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their data and their colleagues in the same visual space. Immersion provides benefits beyond the traditional “desktop” visualization tools: it leads to a demonstrably better perception of a datascape geometry, more intuitive data understanding, and a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data.",,,donalek2014immersive,,,10.1109/BigData.2014.7004282,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this poster we describe a VR-based handball system, which supports the evaluation of perceptual-motor skills of handball goalkeepers during shots. In order to allow reliable analyses it is essential that goalkeepers can move naturally like they would do in a real game situation, which is often inhibited by wires or markers that are usually used in VR systems. To address this challenge, we developed a camera-based goalkeeper analysis system, which allows to detect and measure motions of goalkeepers in real-time.",,,BZBSHFS10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in shared environments, or to support inclusion and training of individuals with social communication disorders. We review and categorize augmentation approaches and propose a software architecture based on four data layers. Three components further handle the status analysis, the modification, and the blending of behaviors.

Common solutions are based on specialised software and/or hardware capable of rendering 3D content, which not only restricts accessibility to specific platforms but also increases the barrier for non expert users. Our approach addresses new audiences by making existing Virtual Environments (VEs) ubiquitously accessible. Its appeal is that a large variety of clients, like desktop PCs and handhelds, are ready to connect to VEs out of the box. We achieve this combining established videoconferencing protocol standards with a server based interaction handling. Currently interaction is based on natural speech, typed textual input and visual feedback, but extensions to support natural gestures are possible and planned.

These phenomena have been observed in both computer-generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper, we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic virtual reality (VR) systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for semiimmersive VR systems, i.e., a passive and active stereoscopic projection system as well as an immersive VR system, i.e., a head-mounted display, and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.",,,steinicke2011change,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG),,,,,17,,9,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and virtual environments generally involves some form of
3D interaction. As such, the design and development of 3D
spatial interaction devices are important in creating more
realistic and immersive user experiences in 3D virtual
environment applications through natural and intuitive
human expression. In general, current commercially
available 3D input devices for virtual reality applications
like data gloves, multiple DOF sensors and trackers, etc.
typically come with a heavy price tag. The objective of this
research is to investigate an approach to setting up an
inexpensive 6-DOF optical tracking system using Wii
Remotes, which is adequate for 3D interaction in an
interactive Head-Mounted Display (HMD) virtual reality
system. For the purpose of HMD virtual reality, a user
should ideally be able to use a 3D interaction device in a
space surrounding the user. This cannot be achieved when
using this game controller in the conventional manner. Also,
normal usage of the controller only allows for relative
positioning and cannot reliably track 6-DOF. This paper
outlines a method of using Wii Remotes for 3D spatial
interaction in an area surrounding the user. This paper also
presents experimental results conducted in order to
benchmark the accuracy of the system, by comparing the
system’s position and orientation estimates with the
readings obtained from a commercial 6-DOF magnetic
tracker.",,,chow2010lowcost,International Journal on Network Security,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systemsâ€related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics.
In previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This workâ€ mshop provides a faceâ€toâ€face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems RIS. Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as realâ€ time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepaâ€ rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current stateâ€ofâ€theâ€art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sumâ€ omarize the work our community is doing.

Arranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop\u0027s goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections:

* Systems. Six development systems are presented InTml, Lightning, FlowVR, OpenMASK VISTA, and MORGAN 
* Abstraction Is â€ sues. Two papers address the issues of reusable VE platforms and alterna tives to scene graphs. 
* Special Issues. In this section we collect papers related to the implementation of RIS in particular platforms, such as mobile systems, multiâ€rate systems, and Mixed Reality. 
* Semantic and Dynamic Modeling. The four papers in this section show models for expliâ€ citly describing semantic (i.e. ä chair is on the floor"") and dynamic information.

The personalized virtual alter egos were generated by state-of-the-art photogrammetry methods. 42 participants were repeatedly exposed to animated versions of their 3D-reconstructed virtual alter egos in each of the three XR display conditions. The reconstructed virtual alter egos were additionally modified in body weight for each repetition. We show that the display types lead to different degrees of incongruence between the renderings of the virtual humans and the presentation of the respective environmental backgrounds, leading to significant effects of perceived mismatches as part of a plausibility measurement. The device-related effects were further partly confirmed by subjective misestimations of the modified body weight and the measured spatial presence. Here, the exceedingly incongruent OST AR condition leads to the significantly highest weight misestimations as well as to the lowest perceived spatial presence. However, similar effects could not be confirmed for the affective appraisal (i.e., humanness, eeriness, or attractiveness) of the virtual humans, giving rise to the assumption that these factors might be unrelated to each other.",,,wolf2022plausibility,,,10.1109/ISMAR55827.2022.00065,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, some objects may have geometric properties that are determined entirely by a physical simulation and which cannot be modified, while other objects may be annotations whose position and size are flexible.

Conceptual design has not benefited from these sophisticated and highly precise software tools to the same degree because the creative activities associated with developing and communicating potential solutions with minimal details is far less formulaic in its implementation. At the early stages of product design the specifications and constraints have not been fully established. The industrial designers and engineers need the freedom to change and modify the product configuration and mechanical behavior to investigate a wide range of alternative solutions. Any CAD system that seeks to support and enhance conceptual design must, therefore, enable natural and haptic modes of human-computer interaction. Recent advancements in high-
speed, multi-core computer hardware and virtual reality (VR) technology provide opportunities to link the more fluid
processes of creative conceptual design with the rigidly defined tasks of product detailing and engineering analysis. This paper

This direct interaction paradigm enables an intuitive method to apply actions by associating iconic representation of objects to each other.

Since dragging of these iconic representations is the most time-consuming subtask of the drag-and-drop metaphor, many extensions of this approach have been proposed to enhance this process.

However, a transfer of these concepts to virtual reality (VR) systems has not been realized.


In this paper we propose the grab-and-throw metaphor which is a VR-based analogon to the drag-and-drop metaphor.

The proposed concepts enable users to select a virtual object by grabbing it and to throw the object within a virtual environment (VE) in the direction of another object.

As soon as the object hits another object, an associated action is performed.


The trajectory of the thrown object is based on physical motions adapted from the real-world.

In order to ease hitting a desired target object, snapping strategies are used such that the aimed object attracts the thrown object.

We give a technical description of the grab-and-throw metaphor and discuss example application scenarios which benefit from the usage of the described metaphor.",,,SH06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These assessments were based on the Welling's scale and OSATS.The VR group performed significantly better in the end product of the dissection (VR 80% vs. traditional 45%, P-value <.001) and caused smaller injuries to anatomic structures (VR 19% vs. traditional 36%, P-value = .01). They also did better in the overall performance score (VR 55% vs. traditional 35%, P-value = .04) There were no differences in the technique score. There was a fair to moderate degree of interrater reliability between the assessors (kappa = 0.33-0.47; Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.34-0.76).Supervised teaching using a VR simulator seems to improve cadaveric temporal bone dissection performance compared with traditional teaching methods.",,,Zhao:2011:Laryngoscope:21433021,Laryngoscope,,10.1002/lary.21287,,,121,,4,,,,,,,,vr,21433021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

	This is a pilot project using Second Life, an Internet-based virtual
	reality system, in which a virtual reality environment was constructed
	to simulate the auditory and visual hallucinations of two patients
	with schizophrenia. Eight hundred sixty-three self-referred users
	took a self-guided tour. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-nine (69%)
	of the users who toured the environment completed a survey. Of the
	survey responders, 440 (76%) thought the environment improved their
	understanding of auditory hallucinations, 69% thought it improved
	their understanding of visual hallucinations, and 82% said they would
	recommend the environment to a friend. CONCLUSIONS: Computer simulations
	of the perceptual phenomena of psychiatric illness are feasible with
	existing personal computer technology. Integration of the evaluation
	survey into the environment itself was possible. The use of Internet-connected

Redgraph is capable of handling large data-sets, as we demonstrate on social network data from the U.S. Patent Trade Office. We develop a Semantic Web vocabulary of virtual reality terms compatible with GraphXML to map graph visualization into the Semantic Web itself. Our approach to visualizing Semantic Web data takes advantage of user-interaction in an immersive environment to bypass a number of difficult issues in 3-dimensional graph visualization layout by relying on users themselves to interactively extrude the nodes and links of a 2-dimensional graph into the third dimension. When users touch nodes in the virtual reality environment, they retrieve data formatted according to the data’s schema or ontology. We applied Redgraph to social network data constructed from patents, inventors, and institutions from the United States Patent and Trademark Office in order to explore networks of innovation in computing. Using this data-set, results of a user study comparing extrusion (3-D) vs. no-extrusion (2-D) are presented. The study showed the use of a 3-D interface by subjects led to significant improvement on answering of fine-grained questions about the data-set, but no significant difference was found for broad questions about the overall structure of the data. Furthermore, inference can be used to improve the visualization, as demonstrated with a data-set of biotechnology patents and researchers.",,,citeulike:4039684,The Semantic Web - ISWC 2008,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1\_38,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,2,4039684,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-02-12 17:43:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results supported the indirect effect of VR features to the learning outcomes, which was mediated by the interaction experience and the learning experience. Learning experience which was individually measured by the psychological factors, that is, presence, motivation, cognitive benefits, control and active learning, and reflective thinking took central stage in affecting the learning outcomes in the desktop VR-based learning environment. The moderating effect of student characteristics such as spatial ability and learning style was also examined.

Tracking technologies and stereoscopic visualization of three-dimensional structures allow a better insight into complex datasets. Unfortunately, these systems often lack intuitive interaction concepts and therefore reduce VRGIS to advanced visualization environments, since manipulation of the content is not or only rudimentarily possible. In this paper, we present a geographic information system for urban planning tasks in semi-immersive virtual reality (VR) systems. The objective of this approach is to provide professional city planners with an enhanced VR interface, which enables comfortable interaction concepts similar to the interactions of the real-world planning task. To assure the usability and relevance of the developed system, urban planners have cooperated closely in the development process.
In this paper both the hard- and software architecture of the entire system as well as VR related interaction metaphors and their evaluation are discussed.",,,SRHM06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focus on the influence of avatar embodiment, visual fidelity, motion perception, and body representation. We summarize findings on the impact of these factors on time perception, discuss lessons learned, and implications for future applications. 
In a waiting room experiment, the passage of time in VR with an avatar was perceived significantly faster than without an avatar. The passage of time in the real waiting room was not perceived as significantly different from the waiting room in VR with or without an avatar.
In an interactive scenario, the absence of a virtual avatar resulted in a significantly slower perceived passage of time compared to the partial and full-body avatar conditions. High and medium embodiment conditions are assumed to be more plausible and to less different from a real experience. 
A virtual tunnel that induced the illusion of self-motion (vection) appeared to contribute to the perceived passage of time and experience of time. This effect was shown to increase with tunnel speed and the number of tunnel segments. 
A framework was proposed for the use of virtual zeitgebers along three dimensions (speed, density, synchronicity) to systematically control the experience of time. The body itself, as well as external objects, seem to be addressed by this theory of virtual zeitgebers. 
Finally, the standardization of the methodology and future research considerations are discussed.",,,landeck2023perception,,,10.18420/muc2023-mci-ws05-442,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen children aged 8-13 years comprised the study group. Children attended eight one-hour virtual reality play sessions in which they were immersed and interacted with virtual reality. The Test of Playfulness (TOP) was used as the measure to assess playfulness. Participants were videotaped while they played during 12 different environments over the course of their intervention time. Three randomly selected virtual reality play sessions were chosen to score three different virtual reality environments within each session yielding a total of nine trials (environments) for each participant. The types of virtual environments varied across participants. Overall, the different virtual reality play environments produced varying levels of playfulness according to the TOP's four different subscale scores. Motivation ranged from 1.50 to 2.25, internal control ranged from 1.00 to 1.88, suspension of reality ranged from 0 to 0.26, and framing ranged from 1.33 to 1.78. The three environments producing the highest playfulness ratings were called Paint, Trip and Island Sounds. These environments allowed creativity, persistence with the task, pleasure, and a certain degree of control. Two environments did not appear to foster playfulness. A possible reason was that these environments were too unpredictable and frustrating for participants. These results will be useful for creating new virtual reality software applications that will encourage playfulness in children with disabilities.",,,Reid2004,Occup Ther Int,,,,,11,,3,,,,public,,2007.06.22,ar0berts,vr,15297894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this research is to investigate the fundamental distinctions between AR and VR in the context of course instruction. Educators can acquire insights into how these technologies might be effectively integrated into the classroom by evaluating their specific traits, affordances, and limits. The research begins by defining AR and VR and then compares their key ideas. AR superimposes digital information on the real-world environment to improve the user's impression of reality, whereas VR immerses users in a simulated environment to create a sensation of presence and immersion. These contrasts lay the groundwork for comprehending their disparate uses in education. The study then goes into the educational benefits and difficulties of AR and VR. AR allows students to interact with digital information in real time, encouraging engagement, collaboration, and contextualized learning. It could bridge the gap between abstract ideas and real-world applications. VR, on the other hand, provides an immersive and regulated environment that allows students to explore complicated scenarios, imitate real-world circumstances, and acquire important skills in a safe and cost-effective manner. The research looks at the technology needs, accessibility concerns, and implementation techniques for AR and VR in educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of pedagogical design, content creation, and teacher training to maximize these technologies' educational impact. This review paper investigates the differences between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in the context of course education. AR and VR have emerged as significant tools for boosting the learning experience as technology continues to alter education. Understanding the distinct characteristics and benefits of each technology is critical for educators to make educated judgments about how to include them in their teaching practices. This paper examines AR and VR in depth, concentrating on their distinctions, uses, and possible influence in educational contexts.",,english,noauthororeditor,International Journal on Orange Technologies,2615-8140,,,,5,,7,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms and success of behavior change techniques and interventions are broadly investigated in the field of psychology. However, it is not always easy to adapt these psychological findings to the context of immersive technologies. The lack of theoretical foundation also leads to a lack of explanation as to why and how immersive interventions support behavior change processes. The Behavioral Framework for immersive Technologies (BehaveFIT) addresses this lack by 1) presenting an intelligible categorization and condensation of psychological barriers and immersive features, by 2) suggesting a mapping that shows why and how immersive technologies can help to overcome barriers and finally by 3) proposing a generic prediction path that enables a structured, theory-based approach to the development and evaluation of immersive interventions. These three steps explain how BehaveFIT can be used, and include guiding questions for each step. Further, two use cases illustrate the usage of BehaveFIT. Thus, the present paper contributes to guidance for immersive intervention design and evaluation, showing that immersive interventions support behavior change processes and explain and predict 'why' and 'how' immersive interventions can bridge the intention-behavior-gap.",,,wienrich2020mind,Frontiers Virtual Reality,,https://doi.org/10.3389/frvir.2021.627194,,,2,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to performance, subjective metrics were also considered, namely the feeling of presence, cybersickness and user satisfaction. The experiments consisted of having participants complete a series of paths with different indexes of difficulty and the time that a participant took to walk each path was measured.

The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.",,,Olshannikova2015,Journal of Big Data,2196-1115,10.1186/s40537-015-0031-2,,,2,,1,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fects of gambling in VR. During the IGT, subjects are challenged to
draw cards from four different decks of which two are advantageous.
The selections made serve as a measure of a participant’s decision
making during the task. In a novel user study, we compared the
effects of immersion on decision making between a low-immersive
desktop-3D-based IGT realization and a high immersive VR version.
Our results revealed significantly more disadvantageous decisions
when playing the immersive VR version. This indicates an impair-
ing effect of immersion on simulated real life decision making and
provides empirical evidence for a high risk potential of gambling
games targeting immersive VR.",,,oberdorfer2020think,,,10.1109/VR46266.2020.00069,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design Prospective randomised controlled and blinded trial.  Setting Seven gynaecological departments in the Zeeland region of Denmark.  Participants 24 first and second year registrars specialising in gynaecology and obstetrics.  Interventions Proficiency based virtual reality simulator training in laparoscopic salpingectomy and standard clinical education (controls).  Main outcome measure The main outcome measure was technical performance assessed by two independent observers blinded to trainee and training status using a previously validated general and task specific rating scale. The secondary outcome measure was operation time in minutes.  Results The simulator trained group (n=11) reached a median total score of 33 points (interquartile range 32-36 points), equivalent to the experience gained after 20-50 laparoscopic procedures, whereas the control group (n=10) reached a median total score of 23 (22-27) points, equivalent to the experience gained from fewer than five procedures (P<0.001). The median total operation time in the simulator trained group was 12 minutes (interquartile range 10-14 minutes) and in the control group was 24 (20-29) minutes (P<0.001). The observers' inter-rater agreement was 0.79.  Conclusion Skills in laparoscopic surgery can be increased in a clinically relevant manner using proficiency based virtual reality simulator training. The performance level of novices was increased to that of intermediately experienced laparoscopists and operation time was halved. Simulator training should be considered before trainees carry out laparoscopic procedures.

The PVQ provides insights into children's inner motives as well as how the virtual environment enhances or attenuates children's motives. Nine VR environments were randomly selected to score with the PVQ. RESULTS: Data were analyzed and descriptive statistics were calculated for modes and medians of total volition scores for each VR environment. Different environments produced varying levels of volitional behaviour. The features of environments that produced higher levels of volition included challenge, variability and competition.

This study compares cadaveric temporal bone (CTB) simulation with the Voxel-Man TempoSurg (VT) virtual reality simulator in addressing these features.A questionnaire was designed comparing the VT with CTB. Fourteen trainees and six consultants completed the questionnaire after using the simulator.The VT is better at allowing repetitive practice, ease of control of difficulty, and capturing clinical and pathological variation. The VT is as good as CTB in curriculum integration, allowing multiple learning strategies, providing a controlled environment, individualising learning and defining benchmarks. It appears worse with regards to face validity and feedback.Virtual reality simulation and CTB have features that allow effective learning. Some of these are common to both, in some CTB is better and in others virtual reality is better.

Hands-on patient experience - the traditional apprenticeship method for teaching operations - may not apply because of the learning curve for skill acquisition and patient safety expectation. The paranasal sinuses and temporal bone have intricate anatomy with a significant amount of vital structures either within the surgical field or in close proximity. The current standard of surgical care in these areas involves the use of endoscopes, cameras and microscopes, requiring additional hand-eye coordination, an accurate command of fine motor skills, and a thorough knowledge of the anatomy under magnified vision. A surgeon's disorientation or loss of perspective can lead to complications, often catastrophic and occasionally lethal. These considerations define the ideal environment for surgical simulation; not surprisingly, significant research and validation of simulators in these areas have occurred.Virtual reality simulators are demonstrating validity as training and skills assessment tools.

As a result of this sensory mismatch, people associate negative symptoms with VR and sometimes avoid the technology altogether. To reconcile the two contradicting sensory perceptions, we investigate GVS to stimulate the vestibular canals behind our ears with low-current electrical signals that are specifically attuned to the visually displayed camera motion. We describe how to calibrate and generate the appropriate GVS signals in real-time for pre-recorded omnidirectional videos exhibiting ego-motion in all three spatial directions. For validation, we conduct an experiment presenting real-world 360° videos shot from a moving first-person perspective in a VR head-mounted display.

The basic idea of the proposed method is to introduce a layer consisting of several fog nodes between clients and cloud server to offload a part of the rendering task which is conducted by the cloud server in conventional cloud games. We examine three techniques to reduce the latency in such a fog-assisted cloud game: 1) To maintain the consistency of the virtual game space, collision detection of virtual objects is conducted by the cloud server in a centralized manner; 2) To reflect subtle changes of the line of sight to the 3D game view, each client is assigned to a fog node and the head motion of the player acquired through HMD (Head-Mounted Display) is directly sent to the corresponding fog node; and 3) To offload a part of the rendering task, we separate the rendering of the background view from that of the foreground view, and migrate the former to other nodes including the cloud server. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by experiments with an AWS-based prototype system. It is confirmed that the proposed techniques achieve the latency of 32.3 ms, which is 66 % faster than the conventional systems.",,english,noauthororeditor,International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications (IJCNC),ISSN 0974 - 9322 (Online); 0975 - 2293 (Print),10.5121/ijcnc.2020.12603,,,12,,6,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of four single case studies are presented. The virtual reality intervention used the Mandala Gesture Xtreme technology. It was applied to four school aged children with cerebral palsy. A pretest-posttest design was used. The relevant outcome of interest was upper extremity control as measured with the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST), item #6 of Subtest #5 of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP), and a measure of percent accuracy . The total scores on the QUEST indicated clinically significant changes in quality of upper extremity for two of the children. Changes were noted in other measures of upper extremity control for each child.Qualitative comments from the participants revealed a high degree of motivation, interest, pleasure, and opportunity for engagement in play activities not previously engaged in. Overall, this pilot study suggests the viability of a virtual reality play based intervention as part of the rehabilitation process for children with cerebral palsy. These results will form the basis of a larger scale randomized clinical trial.",,,citeulike:892904,Technology & Disability,,,,,14,,2,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,2,892904,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study outlines how to evaluate the compatibility of a given EEG-VR setup on the example of two commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs), the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro. We use a novel experimental protocol to compare the spectral composition between conditions with and without an HMD present during an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task. We found general artifacts at the line hum of 50 Hz, and additional HMD refresh rate artifacts (90 Hz) for the Oculus rift exclusively. Frequency components typically most interesting to non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz), however, remained largely unaffected. We observed similar topographies of visually-induced modulation of alpha band power for both HMD conditions in all subjects. Hence, the study introduces a necessary validation test for HMDs in combination with EEG and further promotes EEG as a potential biometric measurement method for psychophysical effects in VR systems.",,,hertweck2019brain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used explicit and implicit measurement methods to identify cultural associations and the degree of stereotypical perception for each virtual stimuli (n = 293) through two online studies, including native German and English-speaking participants. The analysis resulted in a final well-describable database of 128 objects (called InteractionSuitcase).

Plausibility, congruence, and their role have recently gained more and more attention. One of the latest models to describe XR experiences, the Congruence and Plausibility model (CaP), puts plausibility and congruence right in the center. However, it is unclear what influence they have on the overall XR experience and what influences our perceived plausibility rating. In this paper, we implemented four different incongruencies within a virtual reality scene using breaks in plausibility as an analogy to breaks in presence. These manipulations were either located on the cognitive or perceptual layer of the CaP model. They were also either connected to the task at hand or not. We tested these manipulations in a virtual bowling environment to see which influence they had. Our results show that manipulations connected to the task caused a lower perceived plausibility. Additionally, cognitive manipulations seem to have a larger influence than perceptual manipulations. We were able to cause a break in plausibility with one of our incongruencies. These results show a first direction on how the influence of plausibility in XR can be systematically investigated in the future.",979-8-3503-2838-7,,brubach2023systematic,,2473-0726,10.1109/ISMAR59233.2023.00105,,ISMAR '23,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,"Sydney, Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,,16-20 October 2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We discuss the design of the VR training. Then, we present the results of a between subject experiment (n=42) with three experimental conditions (control, training once, repeated training) investigating learning effects on subjects' negotiation skill and knowledge. In our case negotiation skill consists of negotiation outcome (final bid utility) and conversation skill (exploratory conversational choices in VR scenario), and negotiation knowledge is the subjects' quality of reflection upon filmed behavior of two negotiating actors. Our results confirm the hypothesis. We found significant effects of training on conversation skill and negotiation knowledge. We found a marginally significant effect of training on negotation outcome. As the effect of training on negotiation outcome was marginally significant and only present when controlling for overshadowing effects of the act of reflecting, we postulate that other learning approaches (e.g., instruction) are needed for trainees to use the information gained during the joint exploration phase of a negotiation for the construction of a bid. Our results are particularly important given the sparse availability of experimental studies that show learning effects of VR negotiation training, and gives additional support to those studies that do report possitive effects such as with the BiLAT system.",978-3-642-33196-1,,Broekens:2012:VRN:2402767.2402795,,,10.1007/978-3-642-33197-8_23,,IVA'12,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,"Santa Cruz, CA",,,,,,2402795,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impairment of a person’s decision-making is a common goal of gambling games. Given the recent trend of gambling using immersive Virtual Reality it is crucial to investigate the effects of both immersion and the virtual environment (VE) on decision-making. In a novel user study, we measured decision-making using three virtual versions of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). The versions differed with regard to the degree of immersion and design of the virtual environment. While emotions affect decision-making, we further measured the positive and negative affect of participants. A higher visual angle on a stimulus leads to an increased emotional response. Thus, we kept the visual angle on the Iowa Gambling Task the same between our conditions. Our results revealed no significant impact of immersion or the VE on the IGT. We further found no significant difference between the conditions with regard to positive and negative affect. This suggests that neither the medium used nor the design of the VE causes an impairment of decision-making. However, in combination with a recent study, we provide first evidence that a higher visual angle on the IGT leads to an effect of impairment.",,,oberdorfer2021enchanted,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,,10.3389/frvir.2021.679277,,,2,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This perspective article challenges this presence-oriented VR theory. First, we argue that a place illusion cannot be the major construct to describe the much wider scope of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR, AR, MR: or XR for short). Second, we argue that there is no plausibility illusion but merely plausibility, and we derive the place illusion caused by the congruent and plausible generation of spatial cues and similarly for all the current model’s so-defined illusions.

Study Design:
Cross-sectional educational design
Methods:
Five residents ranging from PGY-1 to
PGY-4 were evaluated at three
settings:
1) Virtual reality temporal bone
simulator,
2) Temporal bone laboratory
3) Operating room.
Using a previously validated
checklist for mastoidectomy, faculty
evaluated the residents for the
following tasks:
1) Identification and definition of
tegmen
2) Definition of sigmoid sinus and
sino-dural angle.
3) Use of drill and
4) Overall surgical performance.
The evaluations on virtual reality
temporal bone simulator were then
compared with the evaluations
conducted in the operating room
and the temporal bone laboratory.
Results:
The mean total score obtained for
residents on VR temporal bone
simulator was 2.54±0.75, 3.13±0.55
for OR, and 2.18±0.29 for temporal
bone laboratory. The mean total
score obtained for all settings among
Otology 1 was 2.27±0.72, and for
Otology 2 was 2.70±0.68.
Conclusion:
The surgical performance on the VR
temporal bone simulator is
concordant with the temporal bone
laboratory performance, which
provides an indirect evidence of
transferability of surgical skills to the
OR. VR simulator can assist in
learning technical skills for
mastoidectomy procedure and attain
surgical competency at a faster rate.",,,malik:2011:laryngoscope,Laryngoscope,,,,,121,,suppl 4,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The possibility of precisely studying gait modulation using standardized protocols of gait analysis closely resembling everyday life scenarios is still an unmet need.Methods: We have developed a fully-immersive virtual reality (VR) environment where subjects have to adjust their walking pattern to avoid collision with a virtual agent (VA) crossing their gait trajectory. We collected kinematic data of 12 healthy young subjects walking in real world (RW) and in the VR environment, both with (VR/A+) and without (VR/A-) the VA perturbation. The VR environment closely resembled the RW scenario of the gait laboratory. To ensure standardization of the obstacle presentation the starting time speed and trajectory of the VA were defined using the kinematics of the participant as detected online during each walking trial.Results: We did not observe kinematic differences between walking in RW and VR/A-, suggesting that our VR environment per se might not induce significant changes in the locomotor pattern. When facing the VA all subjects consistently reduced stride length and velocity while increasing stride duration. Trunk inclination and mediolateral trajectory deviation also facilitated avoidance of the obstacle.Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study shows that our VR/A+ paradigm effectively induced a timely gait modulation in a standardized immersive and realistic scenario.

                 improved visual representations of high dimensional
                 objective spaces using virtual reality. These spaces
                 arise from the solution of multi-objective optimisation
                 problems with more than 3 objective functions which
                 lead to high dimensional Pareto fronts. The 3-D
                 representations of m-dimensional Pareto fronts, or
                 their approximations, are constructed via similarity
                 structure mappings between the original objective
                 spaces and the 3-D space. Alpha shapes are introduced
                 for the representation and compared with previous
                 approaches based on convex hulls. In addition, the
                 mappings minimising a measure of the amount of
                 dissimilarity loss are obtained via genetic
                 programming. This approach is preliminarily
                 investigated using both theoretically derived high
                 dimensional Pareto fronts for a test problem (DTLZ2)

However, relatively little is known about the potential of this technology to support teaching and learning with groups of young children in the classroom. Analysis of teacher–child dialogue in a comparative study between use of an AR virtual mirror interface and more traditional science teaching methods for 10-year-old children, revealed that the children using AR were less engaged than those using traditional resources. We suggest four design requirements that need to be considered if AR is to be successfully adopted into classroom practice.

The possibility of precisely studying gait modulation using standardized protocols of gait analysis closely resembling everyday life scenarios is still an unmet need.Methods: We have developed a fully-immersive virtual reality (VR) environment where subjects have to adjust their walking pattern to avoid collision with a virtual agent (VA) crossing their gait trajectory. We collected kinematic data of 12 healthy young subjects walking in real world (RW) and in the VR environment, both with (VR/A+) and without (VR/A-) the VA perturbation. The VR environment closely resembled the RW scenario of the gait laboratory. To ensure standardization of the obstacle presentation the starting time speed and trajectory of the VA were defined using the kinematics of the participant as detected online during each walking trial.Results: We did not observe kinematic differences between walking in RW and VR/A-, suggesting that our VR environment per se might not induce significant changes in the locomotor pattern. When facing the VA all subjects consistently reduced stride length and velocity while increasing stride duration. Trunk inclination and mediolateral trajectory deviation also facilitated avoidance of the obstacle.Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study shows that our VR/A+ paradigm effectively induced a timely gait modulation in a standardized immersive and realistic scenario. This protocol could be a powerful research tool to study gait modulation and its derangements in relation to aging and clinical conditions.",,,10.3389/fnhum.2022.783452,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,1662-5161,10.3389/fnhum.2022.783452,,,16,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other varieties of the so-called eXtended Realities (XR), e.g., Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR and MR) incorporate immersive features to a lesser degree and continuously combine spatial cues from the real physical space and the simulated virtual space. This blurred separation questions the applicability of the accumulated knowledge about the similarities of virtual presence and presence occurring in other varieties of XR, and corresponding outcomes. The present work bridges this gap by analyzing the construct of presence in mixed realities (MR). To achieve this, the following presents (1) a short review of definitions, dimensions, and measurements of presence in VR, and (2) the state of the art views on MR. Additionally, we (3) derived a working definition of MR, extending the Milgram continuum. This definition is based on entities reaching from real to virtual manifestations at one time point. Entities possess different degrees of referential power, determining the selection of the frame of reference. Furthermore, we (4) identified three research desiderata, including research questions about the frame of reference, the corresponding dimension of transportation, and the dimension of realism in MR. Mainly the relationship between the main aspects of virtual presence of immersive VR, i.e., the place-illusion, and the plausibility-illusion, and of the referential power of MR entities are discussed regarding the concept, measures, and design of presence in MR. Finally, (5) we suggested an experimental setup to reveal the research heuristic behind experiments investigating presence in MR. The present work contributes to the theories and the meaning of and approaches to simulate and measure presence in MR. We hypothesize that research about essential underlying factors determining user experience (UX) in MR simulations and experiences is still in its infancy and hopes this article provides an encouraging starting point to tackle related questions.",,,wienrichspatial,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,2673-4192,10.3389/frvir.2021.694315,,,2,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These phenomena have been observed in both computer generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic projection systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for passive and active stereoscopic viewing and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we find that change blindness phenomena can be applied with a larger magnitude as compared to monoscopic viewing of a scene.

We demonstrate the close relationship between scalability, reproduction accuracy, and the resulting performance characteristics, as well as the impact of these characteristics on users co-located with larger groups of embodied virtual others. System scalability provides a variable number of co-located avatars and AI-controlled agents with a variety of different appearances, including realistic-looking virtual humans generated from photogrammetry scans. The article reports on how to meet the requirements of embodied SVR with today\u0027s technical off-the-shelf solutions and what to expect regarding features, performance, and potential limitations. Special care has been taken to achieve low latencies and sufficient frame rates necessary for reliable communication of embodied social signals. We propose a hybrid evaluation approach which coherently relates results from technical benchmarks to subjective ratings and which confirms required performance characteristics for the target scenario of larger distributed groups. A user-study reveals positive effects of an increasing number of co-located social companions on the quality of experience of virtual worlds, i.e., on presence, possibility of interaction, and co-presence. It also shows that variety in avatar/agent appearance might increase eeriness but might also stimulate an increased interest of participants about the environment.",,,latoschik2019alone,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG),1077-2626,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2899250,,,25,,5,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

little follow-through. Part of the reason for this is the prohibitive cost of
immersive VR headsets or caves. This has changed with the advent of
smartphone-based VR (along the lines of Google cardboard) which allows students
to use smartphones and inexpensive plastic or cardboard viewers to enjoy
stereoscopic VR simulations. We have completed the largest-ever such study on
627 students enrolled in calculus-based freshman physics at The Ohio State
University. This initial study focused on student understanding of electric
fields. Students were split into three treatments groups: VR, video, and static
2D images. Students were asked questions before, during, and after treatment.
Here we present a preliminary analysis including overall post-pre improvement
among the treatment groups, dependence of improvement on gender, and previous
video game experience. Results on select questions are discussed. Several
electric field visualizations similar to those used in this study are freely

application. Today, however, user evaluations of humanoid robots are often based on mediated depictions rather than actual observations or interactions with a robot, which holds true not least for scientific user studies. People can be confronted with robots in various modes of presentation, among them (1) 2D videos, (2) 3D, i.e., stereoscopic videos, (3) immersive Virtual Reality (VR), or (4) live on site. A systematic investigation into how such differential modes of presentation influence user perceptions of a robot is still lacking. Thus, the current study systematically compares the effects of different presentation modes with varying immersive potential on user evaluations of a humanoid service robot. Participants (N = 120) observed an interaction between a humanoid service robot and an actor either on 2D or 3D video, via a virtual reality headset (VR) or live. We found support for the expected effect of the presentation mode on perceived immediacy. Effects regarding the degree of human likeness that was attributed to the robot were mixed. The presentation mode had no influence on evaluations in terms of eeriness, likability, and purchase intentions. Implications for empirical research on humanoid robots and practice are discussed.",,,mara2021responses,Frontiers in Psychology - Human-Media Interaction,1664-1078,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.633178,,,12,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over 6 days, the patient spent half of his physiotherapy sessions using VR and the other half without (order randomized). Traditional pharmacological pain management was administered throughout the trial. Using a subjective pain scale (five faces denoting levels of pain), the patient's overall pain ratings whilst in the VR (experimental) condition were 41.2\% less than those in the no-VR (control) condition.

Users were immersed in a virtual room via a head mounted display (HMD). Their full-body movements were tracked and mapped to respective movements of their avatars. Embodiment was induced by presenting the users’ avatars to themselves in a virtual mirror. Afterwards they had to react to a non-verbal behavior of a virtual interaction partner they encountered in the virtual space. Several measures were taken to analyze the effect of the appearance of the users’ avatars as well as the effect of the appearance of the others’ avatars on the users. The realistic avatars were rated significantly more human-like when used as avatars for the others and evoked a stronger acceptance in terms of virtual body ownership (VBO).

By far the most natural way to move through the real world is via locomotion like walking or running. The same should also be true for computer generated three-dimensional environments. Keeping such an active and dynamic ability to navigate through large-scale virtual scenes is of great interest for many 3D applications demanding locomotion, such as tourism, architecture or interactive entertainment. However, today it is still mostly impossible to freely walk through computer generated environments in order to actively explore them. The primary reason for this is the scientific and technological underdevelopment in this sector. While moving in the real world, sensory information such as vestibular, proprioceptive, and efferent copy signals as well as visual information create consistent multi-sensory cues that indicate one's own motion, i.e., acceleration, speed and direction of travel. Computer graphics environments were initially restricted to visual displays, combined with interaction devices, e.g. joystick or mouse, for providing (often unnatural) inputs to generate self-motion. Nowadays, more and more interaction devices, e.g., Nintendo's Wii or Sony's EyeToy, enable intuitive and natural interaction. In this context, many research groups are investigating natural, multimodal methods of generating self-motion in virtual worlds based on these consumer hardware. An obvious approach is to transfer the user's tracked head movements to changes of the camera in the virtual world by means of a one-to-one mapping. Then, a one meter movement in the real world is mapped to a one meter movement of the virtual camera in the corresponding direction in the virtual environment (VE). This technique has the drawback that the user's movements are restricted by a limited range of the tracking sensors, e.g. optical cameras, and a rather small workspace in the real world. The size of the virtual world often differs from the size of the tracked space so that a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not possible. Thus, concepts for virtual locomotion methods are needed that enable walking over large distances in the virtual world while remaining within a relatively small space in the real world. In this tutorial we will present an overview about the development of locomotion interfaces for computer generated virtual environments ranging from desktop-based camera manipulations simulating walking, and different walking metaphors for virtual reality (VR)-based environments to state-of-the-art hardware-based solutions that enable omni-directional and unlimited real walking through virtual worlds.",,,BMC10,,,,,Course Notes of the Joint Virtual Reality Conference of EuroVR - EGVE - VEC,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and wordgesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.",,,kern2023input,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,1941-0506,10.1109/TVCG.2023.3247098,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One approach currently attracting attention is the application of adaptive tile-based streaming solutions to the VR video arena. The VR videos are encoded at different quality levels, temporally divided into segments and spatially split into tiles. During the streaming, each of these tiles can be transmitted independently according to its location within the frame (i.e., within or outside of the user's field of view). These methods open a new venue for bandwidth and latency optimization for the streaming of VR videos. However, the effect of the different adaptive streaming optimizations on the end-user perception is still an open research topic. In this demo, we present a VR video platform to experience the working principles of adaptive tile-based VR video streaming services. Through different tiling approaches, bandwidth conditions and viewport algorithms, it allows the users to explore the effects that each optimization has on the perception of the service. In addition, the platform provides real-time bandwidth savings and objective Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements to provide a quantitative analysis of the optimizations effects. This demo aims to provide a common playground for researchers to benchmark, and evaluate the performance of their optimization solutions.",,,Heyse18ITC30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EFs are important cognitive functions for athletes. They are a relevant quality that distinguishes amateurs from professionals.
Method: The system is based on immersive technology, hence, the user interacts naturally and experiences a training session in a virtual world. The proposed system has a modular design supporting the extension of various so-called game modes. Game modes combine selected game mechanics with specific simulation content to target particular training aspects. The system architecture decouples selection/parameterization and analysis of training sessions via a coaching app from an Unity3D-based VR simulation core. Monitoring of user performance and progress is recorded by a database that sends the necessary feedback to the coaching app for analysis. Results: The system is tested for VR-critical performance criteria to reveal the usefulness of a new interaction paradigm in the cognitive training and analysis of EFs. Subjective ratings for overall usability show that the design as VR application enhances the user experience compared to a traditional desktop app; whereas the new, unfamiliar interaction paradigm does not negatively impact the effort for using the application.
Conclusion: The system can provide immersive training of EF in a fully virtual environment, eliminating potential distraction. It further provides an easy-to-use analyzes tool to compare user but also an automatic, adaptive training mode.",,,krupitzer2022cortexvr,Frontiers in Psychology,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.754732,,,13:754732,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cortical activation and associated motor development were measured before and after VR therapy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and standardized motor tests. Before VR therapy, the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices (SMCs) and ipsilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) were predominantly activated during affected elbow movement. After VR therapy, the altered activations disappeared and the contralateral SMC was activated.

For a believable appearance, consistent lighting of the virtual objects is required. We present an augmented reality system that displays virtual objects with consistent illumination and shadows in the image of a simple webcam. We use two high dynamic range video cameras with fisheye lenses permanently recording the environment illumination. A sampling algorithm selects a few bright parts in one of the wide angle images and the corresponding points in the second camera image. The 3D position can then be calculated using epipolar geometry. Finally, the selected point lights are used in a multipass algorithm to draw the virtual object with shadows. To validate our approach, we compare the appearance and shadows of the synthetic objects with real objects.",,,KSvA07,Journal of Virtual Reality and Broadcasting,,,,,4,,12,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is based on VRML/X3D to enable rendering of audio-visual information. We extended our VRML rendering system by a device management system that is based on the concept of a data-flow graph. The aim of the system is to create Mixed Reality (MR) applications simply by plugging together small prefabricated software components, instead of compiling monolithic C++ applications. The flexibility and the advantages of the presented framework are explained on the basis of an exemplary implementation of a classic Augmented Realityapplication and its extension to a collaborative remote expert scenario.",,,sd06,Journal of Virtual Reality and Broadcasting,,,,,3,,7,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very little objective evidence is available yet on the matter. This study was conducted to identify factors that influence surgeons' performance, as measured by a virtual reality computer simulator for laparoscopic surgery.This study included 25 surgical residents who had limited experience with laparoscopic surgery, having performed fewer than 10 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The participants were registered according to their gender, hand dominance, and experience with computer games. All of the participants performed 10 repetitions of the six tasks on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) within 1 month. Assessment of laparoscopic skills was based on three parameters measured by the simulator: time, errors, and economy of hand movement.Differences in performance existed between the compared groups. Men completed the tasks in less time than women ( p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test), but there was no statistical difference between the genders in the number of errors and unnecessary movements. Individuals with right hand dominance performed fewer unnecessary movements ( p = 0.045, Mann-Whitney test), and there was a trend toward better results in terms of time and errors among the residence with right hand dominance than among those with left dominance. Users of computer games made fewer errors than nonusers ( p = 0.035, Mann-Whitney test).The study provides objective evidence of a difference in laparoscopic skills between surgeons differing gender, hand dominance, and computer experience. These results may influence the future development of training program for laparoscopic surgery.

We present a high-fidelity prototype of an advanced VR system that allows users to embody a rapidly generated personalized, photorealistic avatar and to realistically modulate its body weight in real-time within a carefully designed virtual environment. In a formative multi-method approach, a total of 12 participants rated the general user experience (UX) of our system during body scan and VR experience using semi-structured qualitative interviews and multiple quantitative UX measures. By using body weight modification tasks, we further compared three different interaction methods for real-time body weight modification and measured our system's impact on the body image relevant measures body awareness and body weight perception. From the feedback received, demonstrating an already solid UX of our overall system and providing constructive input for further improvement, we derived a set of design guidelines to guide future development and evaluation processes of systems supporting body image interventions.",,,dollinger2022resize,arXiv,,10.48550/arXiv.2203.05060,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted at the Imperial College Virtual Reality Surgical Skills laboratory amongst 25 trainees and nine senior gynaecologists. Participants performed two sessions of salpingectomy and salpingotomy procedures on a VR simulator to assess construct validity. Nine novices performed ten such sessions to enable assessment of the learning curve. The relationship between cognitive load and the dexterity parameters was assessed. Simulator fidelity was reported by experienced and intermediate level gynaecologists. Statistical analyses utilised non-parametric tests, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Learning curves were assessed using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Relationship between dexterity metrics and cognitive load was performed using Spearman's rank order correlation. RESULTS: Salpingectomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken by experienced, intermediate and novice gynaecologists (median 170 vs. 191 vs. 313s (P=0.003) respectively) and movements (median 200 vs. 267 vs. 376s, P=0.045). Salpingotomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken (median 183 vs. 191 vs. 306s, P=<0.001) and movements (median 210 vs. 233 vs. 328s, P=0.005). Learning curve analysis for salpingectomy displayed a plateau for time taken after the eighth session, and the fourth session for movements. Salpingotomy displayed a plateau after the eighth session for both time taken and movements. Cognitive load correlated significantly with dexterity parameters. The fidelity scores were not significantly different between the two procedures (P=0.619). CONCLUSION: The LAP Mentor VR laparoscopic simulator is a valid and effective tool for training novice surgeons in ectopic pregnancy surgery. Reduction in cognitive load significantly correlates with the learning curves.",,,Bharathan:2013:Eur-J-Obstet-Gynecol-Reprod-Biol:23608628,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2013.03.017,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,23608628,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test whether this didactic principle is suitable for fostering the media pedagogical competencies of the target group in and with VR and to identify further design principles, a mixed-methods approach was utilized. The data collection consisted of focus group interviews, which were analyzed via qualitative content analysis, and Teacher Educator Technology Surveys (TETS).

Due to weight stigmatization, many affected individuals suffer from body image disturbances whereby they perceive their body in a distorted way, evaluate it negatively, or neglect it. Beyond established interventions such as mirror exposure, recent advancements aim to complement body image treatments by the embodiment of visually altered virtual bodies in virtual reality (VR). We present a high-fidelity prototype of an advanced VR system that allows users to embody a rapidly generated personalized, photorealistic avatar and to realistically modulate its body weight in real-time within a carefully designed virtual environment. In a formative multi-method approach, a total of 12 participants rated the general user experience (UX) of our system during body scan and VR experience using semi-structured qualitative interviews and multiple quantitative UX measures. By using body weight modification tasks, we further compared three different interaction methods for real-time body weight modification and measured our system's impact on the body image relevant measures body awareness and body weight perception. From the feedback received, demonstrating an already solid UX of our overall system and providing constructive input for further improvement, we derived a set of design guidelines to guide future development and evaluation processes of systems supporting body image interventions.",,,dollinger2022resize,arXiv,,10.48550/arXiv.2203.05060,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While generally presumed innocuous, recent studies have demonstrated that motion data actually has the potential to uniquely identify VR users. In this study, we go a step further, showing that a variety of private user information can be inferred just by analyzing motion data recorded from VR devices. We conducted a large-scale survey of VR users (N=1,006) with dozens of questions ranging from background and demographics to behavioral patterns and health information. We then obtained VR motion samples of each user playing the game ""Beat Saber,"" and attempted to infer their survey responses using just their head and hand motion patterns. Using simple machine learning models, over 40 personal attributes could be accurately and consistently inferred from VR motion data alone. Despite this significant observed leakage, there remains limited awareness of the privacy implications of VR motion data, highlighting the pressing need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in multi-user VR applications.",,,nair2023inferring,,,arXiv:2305.19198,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2305.19198,,,,,,,arXiv,cs.HC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systemsâ€related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics.
In previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This workâ€ mshop provides a faceâ€toâ€face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems RIS. Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as realâ€ time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepaâ€ rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current stateâ€ofâ€theâ€art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sumâ€ omarize the work our community is doing.

Arranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop's goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections:

* Systems. Six development systems are presented InTml, Lightning, FlowVR, OpenMASK VISTA, and MORGAN 
* Abstraction Is â€ sues. Two papers address the issues of reusable VE platforms and alterna tives to scene graphs. 
* Special Issues. In this section we collect papers related to the implementation of RIS in particular platforms, such as mobile systems, multiâ€rate systems, and Mixed Reality. 
* Semantic and Dynamic Modeling. The four papers in this section show models for expliâ€ citly describing semantic (i.e. ä chair is on the floor"") and dynamic information.

New technologies like immersive Virtual Reality (VR) offer more possibilities to exploit erroneous beliefs in the context of gambling. Recent research indicates a higher risk potential when playing a slot machine in VR than on desktop. To continue this investigation, we evaluate the effects of providing different degrees of embodiment, i.e., minimal and full embodiment. The avatars used for the full embodiment further differ in their appearance, i.e., they elicit a high or a low socio-economic status. The virtual environment (VE) design can cause a potential influence on the overall gambling behavior. Thus, we also embed the slot machine in two different VEs that differ in their emotional design: a colorful underwater playground environment and a virtual counterpart of our lab. These design considerations resulted in four different versions of the same VR slot machine: 1) full embodiment with high socio-economic status, 2) full embodiment with low socio-economic status, 3) minimal embodiment playground VE, and 4) minimal embodiment laboratory VE. Both full embodiment versions also used the playground VE. We determine the risk potential by logging gambling frequency as well as stake size, and measuring harm-inducing factors, i.e., dissociation, urge to gamble, dark flow, and illusion of control, using questionnaires. Following a between groups experimental design, 82 participants played for 20 game rounds one of the four versions. We recruited our sample from the students enrolled at the University of Würzburg. Our safety protocol ensured that only participants without any recent gambling activity took part in the experiment. In this comparative user study, we found no effect of the embodiment nor VE design on neither the gambling frequency, stake sizes, nor risk potential. However, our results provide further support for the hypothesis of the higher visual angle on gambling stimuli and hence the increased emotional response being the true cause for the higher risk potential.",,,oberdorfer2022embodied,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,2673-4192,10.3389/frvir.2022.828553,,,3,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New technologies like immersive Virtual Reality (VR) offer more possibilities to exploit erroneous beliefs in the context of gambling. Recent research indicates a higher risk potential when playing a slot machine in VR than on desktop. To continue this investigation, we evaluate the effects of providing different degrees of embodiment, i.e., minimal and full embodiment. The avatars used for the full embodiment further differ in their appearance, i.e., they elicit a high or a low socio-economic status. The virtual environment (VE) design can cause a potential influence on the overall gambling behavior. Thus, we also embed the slot machine in two different VEs that differ in their emotional design: a colorful underwater playground environment and a virtual counterpart of our lab. These design considerations resulted in four different versions of the same VR slot machine: 1) full embodiment with high socio-economic status, 2) full embodiment with low socio-economic status, 3) minimal embodiment playground VE, and 4) minimal embodiment laboratory VE. Both full embodiment versions also used the playground VE. We determine the risk potential by logging gambling frequency as well as stake size, and measuring harm-inducing factors, i.e., dissociation, urge to gamble, dark flow, and illusion of control, using questionnaires. Following a between groups experimental design, 82 participants played for 20 game rounds one of the four versions. We recruited our sample from the students enrolled at the University of Würzburg. Our safety protocol ensured that only participants without any recent gambling activity took part in the experiment. In this comparative user study, we found no effect of the embodiment nor VE design on neither the gambling frequency, stake sizes, nor risk potential. However, our results provide further support for the hypothesis of the higher visual angle on gambling stimuli and hence the increased emotional response being the true cause for the higher risk potential.",,,oberdorfer2022embodied,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,,10.3389/frvir.2022.828553,,,3,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they are still far less common than unimodal interfaces (UMIs). This paper presents a summative user study comparing an MMI to a typical UMI for a design task in VR. We developed an application targeting creative 3D object manipulations, i.e., creating 3D objects and modifying typical object properties such as color or size. The associated open user task is based on the Torrence Tests of Creative Thinking. We compared a synergistic multimodal interface using speech-accompanied pointing/grabbing gestures with a more typical unimodal interface using a hierarchical radial menu to trigger actions on selected objects. Independent judges rated the creativity of the resulting products using the Consensual Assessment Technique. Additionally, we measured the creativity-promoting factors flow, usability, and presence. Our results show that the MMI performs on par with the UMI in all measurements despite its limited flexibility and reliability. These promising results demonstrate the technological maturity of MMIs and their potential to extend traditional interaction techniques in VR efficiently.",9781450375818,,10.1145/3382507.3418850,,,10.1145/3382507.3418850,,ICMI '20,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,"Virtual Event, Netherlands",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we conducted a between-subjects design with and without avatar embodiment as well as a real condition (avatar vs. no-avatar vs. real). A group of 105 healthy subjects had to wait for seven and a half minutes in a room without any distractors (e.g., no window, magazine, people, decoration) or time indicators (e.g., clocks, sunlight). The virtual environment replicates the real physical environment. Participants were unaware that they will be asked to estimate their waiting time duration as well as describing their experience of the passage of time at a later stage. Our main finding shows that the presence of an avatar is leading to a significantly faster perceived passage of time. It seems to be promising to integrate avatar embodiment in future VR time-based therapy applications as they potentially could modulate a user's perception of the passage of time.

Hier werden beispielhaft zwei der erstellten Unterrichtsentwürfe für VR Interventionen vorgestellt und diskutiert. Begleitend zum Seminar wurden empirische Daten erhoben. Zum einen wurde das Potenzial des InteractionSuitcase (eine Sammlung virtueller Objekte) von den Studierenden bewertet. Zum anderen wurde explorativ eine qualitative Methode zur Messung interkultureller Kompetenz (Autobiography of Intercultural Encounters) getestet. Die Ergebnisse dieser explorativen Pilotstudie zeigen, dass die Interaktion mit dem InteractionSuitcase von den Studierenden als intuitiv und gewinnbringend für die Konzeption von Unterrichtskonzepten bewertet wurde. Dennoch integrierten die Studierenden die Manipulation der virtuellen Avatare häufiger im Gegensatz zum InteractionSuitcase in die Unterrichtskonzepte. Der Beitrag verfolgt das Ziel, das Potenzial von VR für inter- und transkulturelles Lernen im gymnasialen Englischunterricht zu identifizieren.",,,hein2023medienpaed,MedienPädagogik: Zeitschrift für Theorie Und Praxis Der Medienbildung,,https://doi.org/10.21240/mpaed/51/2023.01.18.X.,,,,,51,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has investigated approaches that strengthen mindfulness, i.e., by inventing multimedia technologies to support mindfulness meditation. These approaches often use smartphones, tablets, or consumer-grade desktop systems to allow everyday usage in users' private lives or in the scope of organized therapies. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR; in short: XR) significantly extend the design space for such approaches. XR covers a wide range of potential sensory stimulation, perceptive and cognitive manipulations, content presentation, interaction, and agency. These facilities are linked to typical XR-specific perceptions that are conceptually closely related to mindfulness research, such as (virtual) presence and (virtual) embodiment. However, a successful exploitation of XR that strengthens mindfulness requires a systematic analysis of the potential interrelation and influencing mechanisms between XR technology, its properties, factors, and phenomena and existing models and theories of the construct of mindfulness. This article reports such a systematic analysis of XR-related research from HCI and life sciences to determine the extent to which existing research frameworks on HCI and mindfulness can be applied to XR technologies, the potential of XR technologies to support mindfulness, and open research gaps. Fifty papers of ACM Digital Library and National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (PubMed) with and without empirical efficacy evaluation were included in our analysis. The results reveal that at the current time, empirical research on XR-based mindfulness support mainly focuses on therapy and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, most of the currently investigated XR-supported mindfulness interactions are limited to vocally guided meditations within nature-inspired virtual environments. While an analysis of empirical research on those systems did not reveal differences in mindfulness compared to non-mediated mindfulness practices, various design proposals illustrate that XR has the potential to provide interactive and body-based innovations for mindfulness practice. We propose a structured approach for future work to specify and further explore the potential of XR as mindfulness-support. The resulting framework provides design guidelines for XR-based mindfulness support based on the elements and psychological mechanisms of XR interactions.",,,10.3389/frvir.2021.644683,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,2673-4192,10.3389/frvir.2021.644683,,,2,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frvir.2021.644683,https://doi.org/10.3389/frvir.2021.644683,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simulator X is targeted at Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and computer games. It provides a foundation and testbed for a variety of different application models. The current research architecture is based on the actor model to support fine grained concurrency and parallelism. Its design follows the minimize coupling and maximize cohesion software engineering principle. A distributed world state and execution scheme is combined with an object-centered world view based on an entity model. Entities conceptually aggregate properties internally represented by state variables. An asynchronous event mechanism allows intra- and interprocess communication between the simulation actors. An extensible world interface uses an ontology-based semantic annotation layer to provide a coherent world view of the resulting distributed world state and execution scheme to application developers. The world interface greatly simplifies configurability and the semantic layer provides a solid foundation for the integration of different Artificial Intelligence components. The current architecture is implemented in Scala using the Java virtual machine. This choice additionally fosters low-level scalability, portability, and reusability.",,,latoschik:2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has investigated approaches that strengthen mindfulness, i.e., by inventing multimedia technologies to support mindfulness meditation. These approaches often use smartphones, tablets, or consumer-grade desktop systems to allow everyday usage in users' private lives or in the scope of organized therapies. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR; in short: XR) significantly extend the design space for such approaches. XR covers a wide range of potential sensory stimulation, perceptive and cognitive manipulations, content presentation, interaction, and agency. These facilities are linked to typical XR-specific perceptions that are conceptually closely related to mindfulness research, such as (virtual) presence and (virtual) embodiment. However, a successful exploitation of XR that strengthens mindfulness requires a systematic analysis of the potential interrelation and influencing mechanisms between XR technology, its properties, factors, and phenomena and existing models and theories of the construct of mindfulness. This article reports such a systematic analysis of XR-related research from HCI and life sciences to determine the extent to which existing research frameworks on HCI and mindfulness can be applied to XR technologies, the potential of XR technologies to support mindfulness, and open research gaps. Fifty papers of ACM Digital Library and National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (PubMed) with and without empirical efficacy evaluation were included in our analysis. The results reveal that at the current time, empirical research on XR-based mindfulness support mainly focuses on therapy and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, most of the currently investigated XR-supported mindfulness interactions are limited to vocally guided meditations within nature-inspired virtual environments. While an analysis of empirical research on those systems did not reveal differences in mindfulness compared to non-mediated mindfulness practices, various design proposals illustrate that XR has the potential to provide interactive and body-based innovations for mindfulness practice. We propose a structured approach for future work to specify and further explore the potential of XR as mindfulness-support. The resulting framework provides design guidelines for XR-based mindfulness support based on the elements and psychological mechanisms of XR interactions.",,,10.3389/frvir.2021.644683,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,2673-4192,10.3389/frvir.2021.644683,,,2,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frvir.2021.644683,https://doi.org/10.3389/frvir.2021.644683,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a number of spatial interaction techniques that optically capture the device′s movement and orientation relative to a visual marker. Such physical interactions in 3D space enable manipulative control of mobile games. In addition to acting as a physical controller that recognizes multiple game-dependent gestures, the mobile device augments the camera view with graphical overlays. We describe three game prototypes that use ubiquitous product packaging and other passive media as backgrounds for handheld augmentation. The prototypes can be realized on widely available off-the-shelf hardware and require only minimal setup and infrastructure support.",,,Roh07,Journal of Virtual Reality and Broadcasting,,,,,4,,5,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rehabilitation of gait disorders in multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke patients is often based on conventional treadmill training. Virtual reality (VR)-based treadmill training can increase motivation and improve therapy outcomes.
Objective. The present study aimed at (1) demonstrating the feasibility and acceptance of an immersive virtual reality application (presented via head-mounted display, HMD) for gait rehabilitation with patients, and (2) compare its effects to a semi-immersive presentation (via a monitor) and a conventional treadmill training without VR. 
Methods and results.  36 healthy participants and 14 persons with MS or stroke participated in each of the three experimental conditions. For both groups, the walking speed in the HMD condition was higher than in treadmill training without VR. Healthy participants reported a higher motivation after the HMD condition as compared with the other conditions. Importantly, no side effects in the sense of simulator sickness occurred and usability ratings were high. Most of the healthy study participants (89 %) and patients (71 %) preferred the HMD-based training among the three conditions and most patients could imagine using it more frequently.
Conclusion. The study demonstrated the feasibility of combining a treadmill training with immersive VR. Due to its high usability and low side effects, the immersive system could serve as a valid alternative to conventional treadmill training in gait rehabilitation. It might be particularly suited for patients to improve training motivation and training outcome e. g. the walking speed compared with treadmill training using no or only semi-immersive VR.",,,winter2021immersive,Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12984-021-00848-w,,,18,,68,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VR systems allow for highly controlled experimental environments, while EEG offers a non-invasive window to brain activity with a millisecond-ranged temporal resolution. However, EEG measurements are highly susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in healthy subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artifacts, especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of 90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected. Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings, at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary devices.",,,weber2021structured,Frontiers in Neuroscience,1662-453X,10.3389/fnins.2021.733673,,,15,,,,,,,,,,vr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Appunta is Open Source and anybody can freely use it. So, what are you waiting for?",2012-04-24 16:14:10,2012-04-24 16:14:10,1,http://appunta.com/sample-page/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Announced during summer '11 and demo'ed for the first time at CSCL in Hong Kong, it will break new ground in location-based AR game building. Features will include:

Visual blocks-based scripting - prevents syntax errors, while enabling programming of rich interactivity.
Interactive data layers and sampling - create models for player exploration and discovery of thought provoking scientific topics.
Conditional dialog creator - interact with characters in new ways; no more single-track conversations
No local installation - the TaleBlazer Game Maker will be entirely web-based for easier implementation in schools and elsewhere
Save to cloud, download to smartphone - logon with your account, and have instant access to games from any computer attached to the Internet, then play from any iOS or Android smartphone with GPS.",2012-10-17 09:35:08,2012-10-17 09:35:08,1,http://education.mit.edu/projects/taleblazer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human beings have an amazing capacity to learn new skills and adapt to new environments. However, several obstacles remain to be overcome in designing paradigms to broadly improve quality of life. Arguably, the most notable impediment to this goal is that learning tends to be quite specific to the trained regimen and does not transfer to even qualitatively similar tasks. This severely limits the potential benefits of learning to daily life. This review discusses training regimens that lead to the acquisition of new knowledge and strategies that can be used flexibly across a range of tasks and contexts. Possible characteristics of training regimens are proposed that may be responsible for augmented learning, including the manner in which task difficulty is progressed, the motivational state of the learner, and the type of feedback the training provides. When maximally implemented in rehabilitative paradigms, these characteristics may greatly increase the efficacy of training.",2009-11-05 15:55:17,2009-11-09 15:39:24,1,http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&uid=2008-19072-003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A robust hyperlink is a URL augmented with a small ""signature"", computed from the referenced document. The signature can be submitted as a query to web search engines to locate the document. It turns out that very small signatures are sufficient to readily locate individual documents out of the many millions on the web.      Robust hyperlinks exhibit a number of desirable qualities: they can be computed and exploited automatically, are small and cheap to compute (so that it is practical to make all hyperlinks robust), do not require new server or infrastructure support, can be rolled out reasonably well in the existing URL syntax, can be used to automatically retrofit existing links to make them robust, and are easy to understand. In particular, one can start using robust hyperlinks now, as servers and web pages are mostly compatible",2011-07-13 18:12:08,2011-07-13 18:12:08,1,http://tunes.org/wiki/robust_20hyperlinks.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with a number of comorbid psychiatric conditions and a reduced quality of life in the young person and with parenting stress, caregiver burden and psychopathology in the parents. The global prevalence (about 1%) is higher than previously thought, with a strong male preponderance. Evidence is emerging that Tourette syndrome is not a unified disorder; rather, it encompasses a number of subtypes, characterised by complexity of tics and the simultaneous presence of other behaviours or disorders. This article discusses the aetiology of the syndrome, and examines its clinical features and comorbid psychiatric conditions and psychopathologies. Assessment and diagnosis are also discussed. Psychoeducation is a cornerstone of management, augmented with behavioural and/or pharmacological treatments.

It consists of a combination of mobile and wearable computing elements supported by a distributed Web application. Content gathered from RAI TV’s historical archives and user-generated media are linked to physical locations in Venice in order to be accessible to all those visiting the space.

The project focuses on the uniqueness of the Italian cities’ heritage superimposing a layer that corresponds to the shared media-based memory of the recent Italian past: the RAI Archives. By taking advantage of the interactivity provided by new media, RAI offers a powerful feedback channel to users, which allows users to generate their own media, create their own stories and, finally, to participate in the media production process.

Locast offers to users the tools to build personalized itineraries, download the content in proximity of Points of Interests and watch them on their handsets in order to improve the overall tourist experience. Users can also perform a number of other actions such as contribute with new videos to Locast repository, follow recommended media itineraries, modify them and share experiences with their social network.

Locast explores location-based narrowcasting potential and actively engages the users to participate in the media production/consumption process together with a historical institution such as RAI TV. It shifts the innovation from the wide-spread concept of Web2.0 to the promising scenario of Space2.0 that keeps the physical and social qualities of the Italian cities and augment them with the potential offered by pervasive computing.",2009-11-24 10:59:13,2009-11-24 10:59:13,1,http://locast.mit.edu/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the heart of the Studierstube system, collaborative augmented reality is used to embed computer-generated images into the real work environment In the #rst part of this paper, we review the user interface of the initial Studierstube system, in particular the implementation of collaborative augmented reality , and the Personal Interaction Panel, a two-handed interface for interaction with the system. In the second part, an extended Studierstube system based on a heterogeneous distributed architecture is presented. This system allows the user to combine multiple approaches--- augmented reality, projection displays, and ubiquitous computing---to the interface as needed. The environment is controlled by the Personal Interaction Panel, a twohanded, pen-and-pad interface that has versatile uses for interacting with the virtual environment. Studierstube also borrows elements from the desktop, such as multitasking and multi-windowing. The resulting software architecture is a user interface management system for complex augmented reality applications.

Ray tracing techniques process pixels independently from each other, allowing an easy integration with image-based tracking techniques, contrary to traditional projection-based rasterization graphics systems, e.g. OpenGL. Therefore, by associating our highly optimized ray tracer with an augmented reality framework, the proposed pipeline is capable to provide high quality rendering with real time interaction between virtual and real objects, such as occlusions, soft shadows, custom shaders, reflections and self-reflections, some of these features only available in our rendering pipeline. As proof of concept, we present a case study with the ARToolKitPlus library and the Microsoft Kinect hardware, both integrated in our pipeline. Furthermore, we show the performance and visual results in high definition of the novel pipeline on modern graphics cards, presenting occlusion and recursive reflection effects between virtual and real objects without the latter ones needing to be previously modeled when using Kinect. Furthermore, an adaptive soft shadow sampling algorithm for ray tracing is presented, generating high quality shadows in real time for most scenes.",,,dosSantos:ea:2012,,,10.1109/SVR.2012.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Augmented reality allows interaction with virtual objects spatially registered in the user’s real environment, in order to provide information, facilitate collaboration and control machines. As the comput- ing and interaction devices necessary for augmented reality become ubiquitously available, opportunities arise for improved interaction and new applications.
Building ubiquitous augmented reality systems presents three software engineering chal- lenges. First, the system must cope with uncertainty regarding the software components; the users’ mobility changes the availability of distributed devices. Second, during development, the system’s desired behavior is ill-defined, as appropriate interaction metaphors are still be- ing researched and users’ preferences change. Third, the system must maintain near-real-time performance to create a convincing user experience.
This dissertation presents a new architectural style, the adaptive service dependency architec- ture, to address these challenges.
The architecture deals with component uncertainty, using middleware for decentralized ser- vice management to dynamically adapt the system’s structure. It builds on existing architec- tural approaches, such as loosely coupled services, service discovery, reflection, and data flow architectures, but additionally considers the interdependencies between distributed services and uses them for system adaption.
With the development technique of design at run time, users and developers address ill- defined requirements by changing the system’s behavior while it is running, facilitating the creation of new applications. This is based on existing agile development methods, but takes additional advantage of the architecture’s adaptive and reflective properties.
Distributed middleware maintains the required performance by decoupling multimedia data flow from system reconfiguration. It combines existing communication and service discovery technologies, but additionally deals with the distributed coordination of networks of interde- pendent services.
Several prototype systems for real-world ubiquitous augmented reality applications have been built using the adaptive service dependency architecture, decentralized middleware, and design at run time. Feedback from users and developers, as well as performance tests, show the concepts’ usefulness for building ubiquitous augmented reality systems.",,,Macwilliams05adecentralized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers in an unblinded standardized manner. The systems were qualitatively evaluated on the basis of the following: neurosurgical subspecialty of application, pathology of treated lesions and lesion locations, real data source, virtual data source, tracking modality, registration technique, visualization processing, display type, and perception location. Eighteen studies were included during the period 1996 to September 30, 2015. The AR systems were grouped by the real data source: microscope (8), hand- or head-held cameras (4), direct patient view (2), endoscope (1), and X-ray fluoroscopy (1) head-mounted display (1).

This is especially important for our application context, which utilizes mobile AR for navigation and other operations in an urban environment. A key problem in the AR field is how to best depict occluded objects in such a way that the viewer can correctly infer the depth relationships between different physical and virtual objects. Showing a single occluded object with no depth context presents an ambiguous picture to the user. But showing all occluded objects in the environments leads to the “Superman’s X-ray vision ” problem, in which the user sees too much information to make sense of the depth relationships of objects. Our efforts differ qualitatively from previous work in AR occlusion, because our application domain involves farfield occluded objects, which are tens of meters distant from the user. Previous work has focused on near-field occluded objects, which are within or just beyond arm’s reach, and which use different perceptual cues. We designed and evaluated a number of sets of display attributes. We then conducted a user study to determine which representations best express occlusion relationships among far-field objects. We identify a drawing style and opacity settings that enable the user to accurately interpret three layers of occluded objects, even in the absence of perspective constraints. 1",,,Livingston03resolvingmultiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a demand for smart home automation access via virtual reality. The proposed system allows the owner to access via virtual reality and controls the home appliances. This is very easy to access. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a low cost but yet flexible, feasible and secure virtual reality based home automation system. In our proposed system we will try to control light, motor and 230v supply. This work also demonstrates the use of virtual reality in the context of the appliance control. In this project we have used image processing techniques for image acquisition, pre processing, image segmentation and feature extraction. The user commands are captured by the camera and transmitted through wireless communication to the receiver end.

Charakteristisch für Augmented Reality (AR) ist die Anreicherung des Sichtfeldes des Betrachters mit rechnergenerierten virtuellen Objekten, um damit Produkt oder Prozessinformationen situationsgerecht im Kontext zur wahrgenommenen Realität intuitiv nutzbar zu machen. Diese innovative Art der Mensch-Technik-Interaktion erfordert neben der anwendungsorientierten Entwicklung der AR-Basistechnologien insbesondere die Berücksichtigung von Benutzeranforderungen bei der ergonomischen Gestaltung von AR-Systemen. Die Projektideen wurden in für die deutsche Industrie relevanten Anwendungsfeldern wie Automobil- und Flugzeugbau, Maschinen- und Anlagenbau realisiert. Eine besondere Perspektive war damit für mittelständische Unternehmen verbunden, die durch verbesserte Diagnose- und Wartungskompetenz flexibler und effizienter agieren können und damit eine Stärkung im globalen Wettbewerb erfahren. Konkret erfolgte im Rahmen von ARVIKA die Konzentration bei der Entwicklung auf das Automobil, bei der Produktion auf das Automobil und Flugzeug und beim Service auf die Kraftwerksanlagentechnik sowie Werkzeug- und Produktionsmaschinen. Dadurch wurden wesentliche industrielle Einsatzfälle von AR abgedeckt und die notwendige anwendungsorientierte Tiefe zur Verifikation dieser neuartigen Technik erreicht. Diese inhaltlichen Schwerpunkte waren in einen Prozess der benutzerzentrierten Systemgestaltung eingebettet, die das Projekt in allen Phasen begleitet und sich auf arbeitswissenschaftliche Methoden stützt. Durch die Einbeziehung potentieller zukünftiger Benutzer wurde sichergestellt, dass die entwickelten AR-Systeme den Anforderungen von Mitarbeitern, Arbeitsprozessen und Märkten entsprechen, die Benutzungsschnittstellen ergonomisch gestaltet wurden und Verbesserungen der Arbeitsorganisation bei den Projektpartnern durch AR-Funktionalitäten in den prototypischen Umsetzungen nachgewiesen werden konnten und somit auch ein Beleg der wirtschaftlichen Effekte stattfand.",,,Schmidt.2004i,,,,,"Fortschrittberichte VDI, Reihe 22, Mensch-Maschine-Systeme",,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chroma automatically adapts the scene-view based on the type of color blindness, and features dedicated algorithms for color saliency. Based on interviews with 23 people with color blindness we implemented four modes to help colorblind individuals distinguish colors they usually can't see. Although Glass still has important limitations, initial tests of Chroma in the lab show that colorblind individuals using Chroma can improve their color recognition in a variety of real-world activities.

Augmented reality (AR) neuronavigation is a significant advance, providing a real-time updated 3D virtual model of anatomical details, overlaid on the real surgical field. Currently, only a few AR systems have been tested in a clinical setting. The aim is to review such devices. We performed a PubMed search of reports restricted to human studies of in vivo applications of AR in any neurosurgical procedure using the search terms ``Augmented reality'' and ``Neurosurgery.'' Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers in an unblinded standardized manner. The systems were qualitatively evaluated on the basis of the following: neurosurgical subspecialty of application, pathology of treated lesions and lesion locations, real data source, virtual data source, tracking modality, registration technique, visualization processing, display type, and perception location. Eighteen studies were included during the period 1996 to September 30, 2015. The AR systems were grouped by the real data source: microscope (8), hand- or head-held cameras (4), direct patient view (2), endoscope (1), and X-ray fluoroscopy (1) head-mounted display (1). A total of 195 lesions were treated: 75 (38.46 \%) were neoplastic, 77 (39.48 \%) neurovascular, and 1 (0.51 \%) hydrocephalus, and 42 (21.53 \%) were undetermined.

We examine the problem of accurately placing virtual annotations at physical target points from a static point of view. While it is easy to line up annotations with a target point&#039;s projection in the view plane, finding the correct distance for the annotation is difficult if the target point is not represented in an environment model. We have found that AR depth cues, such as vertical and horizontal shadow planes, a small top-down map, or color encodings of relative depth, have a positive impact on a user&#039;s ability to align a 3D cursor with physical objects at various distances. These cues aid the user&#039;s depth perception and estimation by providing information about the 3D cursor&#039;s distance and its relationship in 3-space to any features that may already have been annotated. We conducted a user study that measures the effects of different depth cues for both absolute 3D cursor placement as well as placement relative to a small number of marked reference points, whose distances are known. Our study provides insight about mobile AR users &#039; ability to judge distances both absolutely and relatively, and we identify techniques that successfully enhance their performance. 1.",,,Wither05hollerert.:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The technology that supports augmented reality will come and go, evolve and change. The underlying principles for creating exciting, useful augmented reality experiences are timeless. Augmented reality designed from a purely technological perspective will lead to an AR experience that is novel and fun for one-time consumption - but is no more than a toy. Imagine a filmmaking book that discussed cameras and special effects software, but ignored cinematography and storytelling! In order to create compelling augmented reality experiences that stand the test of time and cause the participant in the AR experience to focus on the content of the experience - rather than the technology - one must consider how to maximally exploit the affordances of the medium. This book addresses core conceptual issues regarding the medium of augmented reality as well as the technology required to support compelling augmented reality. By addressing AR as a medium at the conceptual level in addition to the technological level, the reader will learn to conceive of AR applications that are not limited by today's technology. At the same time, ample examples are provided that show what is possible with current technology.",978-0-240-82408-6,,Craig13,,,,,,,ACM Learning Center eBook:2013/Craig13.pdf:PDF;Amazon Search inside:http\://www.amazon.de/gp/reader/0240824083/:URL,,,,,public,2224bc135078d923845ee22d13145fd4,2013.07.01,flint63,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work is to assess how virtual and augmented reality interface paradigms can provide enhanced location based services using real-time techniques in the context of these two different technologies. The virtual reality interface is based on faithful graphical representation of the localities of interest, coupled with sensory information on the location and orientation of the user, while the augmented reality interface uses computer vision techniques to capture patterns from the real environment and overlay additional way-finding information, aligned with real imagery, in real-time. The knowledge obtained from the evaluation of the virtual reality navigational experience has been used to inform the design of the augmented reality interface.

See-through head worn displays overlay the virtual environment on the physical environment, visualizing the pervasive ""virtual ether"" within which all interaction occurs.Our prototype includes additional 2D and 3D displays, ranging from palm-sized to wall-sized, allowing the most appropriate one to be used for any task. Objects can be moved among displays (including across dimensionalities) through drag & drop.In analogy to 2D window managers, we describe a prototype implementation of a shared 3D environment manager that is distributed across displays, machines, and operating systems.

To identify all papers which include AR evaluations we reviewed research publications between the years 1993 and 2007 from online databases of selected scientific publishers. Starting with a total of 6071 publications we filtered the articles in several steps which resulted in 165 AR related publications with user evaluations. These publications were classified in two different ways: according to the evaluation type used following an earlier literature survey classification scheme; and according to the evaluation methods or approach used. We present the results of out literature survey, provide a comprehensive list of references of the selected publications, and discuss some possible research opportunities for future work.",,,1508049,,,http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1508044.1508049,,SIGGRAPH Asia '08,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Singapore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, existing AR systems like MARS 1 or Tinmith 2, which require a user to wear a notebook computer in a backpack and a head-mounted display (HMD) are expensive, fragile and inconvenient to wear. Thin-client approaches using a Tablet PC or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) merely as a portable display 34 require a dedicated server infrastructure and limit mobility. We believe there is a need for an unconstrained, infrastructureindependent AR display running to fill the gap in situations where traditional backpack systems are too costly and cumbersome, but thin client implementations exhibit inadequate deployability, scalability or interactive behavior. Particular examples include sporadic use over lengthy time spans, in between which devices must be stowed away, mixed indoor/outdoor use in wide-area environments, and massively multi-user application scenarios. This has motivated us to develop a state of the art AR framework targeting lightweight handheld displays.",,,1667684,,1087-8270,10.1109/VR.2006.67,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first prototype operated at 16 frames per second, whereas the second, improved version had 20 frames per second. In addition, the hand-eye coordination while wearing the welding helmet with video see-through head-mounted display was compared to a performance with natural vision, without any helmet.

Augmented reality (AR) can naturally complement ubiquitous computing by providing an intuitive and collaborative visualization and simulation interface to a three-dimensional information space embedded within physical reality. This paper presents a service framework and its applications for providing context-aware and adaptable 3D visualization and collaboration services for ubiquitous cars (U-cars) using augmented reality, which can support a rich set of ubiquitous car services and collaboration services for distributed maintenance and repair. It utilizes augmented reality for providing visual interactions by superimposing virtual models of car components or sub-assemblies onto real cars, which realizes bi-augmentation between physical and virtual models. It also offers a context processing module to acquire, interpret and disseminate context information. In particular, the context processing module considers user’s preferences for providing customer’s context adaptable services.

Nowadays embedding advertisements, or incorporating text and graphics in TV scenes, are common practice, but they can not be considered as integrated part of the scene. The introduction of new services for interactive augmented television is discussed in this paper. We analyse the main aspects related with the whole chain of augmented reality production.

Interactivity is one of the most important added values of the digital television: This paper aims to break the model where all TV viewers receive the same final image. Thus, we introduce and discuss the new concept of interactive augmented television, i. e. real time composition of video and computer graphics - e.g. a real scene and freely selectable images or spatial rendered objects - edited and customized by the end user within the context of the user's set top box and TV receiver.

We demonstrate a sample application introducing ""Interactive Augmented Television"" for sport broadcasts additionally with 3D virtual objects in order to enhance or alter the presentation of the match with a new interface. We also introduce a pure virtual world where the user can select the camera position.",,,omk06,Journal of Virtual Reality and Broadcasting,,,,,3,,13,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The system allows multiple users to experience a shared 3D workspace populated by multiple applications using see-through head mounted displays or other presentation media such as projection systems. The system design is based on a distributed shared scene graph that alleviates the application programmer from explicitly considering distribution, and avoids a separation of graphical and application data. The idea of unifying all system data in the scene graph is taken to its logical consequence by implementing application instances as nodes in the scene graph. Through the distributed shared scene graph mechanism, consistency of scene graph replicas and the contained application nodes is assured. Multi-user 3D widgets allow concurrent interaction with minimal coordination effort from the application. Special interest is paid to migration of application nodes from host to host allowing dynamic workgroup management, such as load balancing, late joining and early exit of hosts, and some firms of ubiquitous computing",,,996505,"Virtual Reality, 2002.

All virtual content, including 3D models and 2D desktop windows, is attached to tracked physical objects in order to leverage the efficiencies of natural two-handed manipulation. The presence of 2D desktop space within 3D facilitates data exchange between the two realms, enables control of 3D information by 2D applications, and generally increases productivity by providing access to familiar tools.

The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.",,,Olshannikova2015,Journal of Big Data,2196-1115,10.1186/s40537-015-0031-2,,,2,,1,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the text-based web page will no longer satisfy users. With the popularity of webcam, digital camera, stereoscopic glasses, or head-mounted display, the user interface becomes more visual and multi-dimensional. For the consideration of 3D and visual display in the research of web user interface design, Augmented Reality technology providing the convenient tools and impressive effects becomes the hot topic. Augmented Reality effect enables users to represent parts of the digital objects on top of the physical surroundings. The easy operation with webcam greatly improving the visual representation of web pages becomes the interest of our research. Therefore, we apply Augmented Reality technology for developing a city tour web site to collect the opinions of users. Therefore, the website stickiness is an important measurement. The major tasks of the work include the exploration of Augmented Reality technology and the evaluation of the outputs of Augmented Reality. The feedback opinions of users are valuable references for improving AR application in the work. As a result, the AR increasing the visual and interactive effects of web page encourages users to stay longer and more than 80\% of users are willing to return for visiting the website soon.

Our Ubiquitous Tracking (Ubitrack) approach seeks to overcome this limitation, not by extending the range of a single tracker, but by dynamically incorporating a number of heterogeneous sensors. The Ubitrack tool set consists of Spatial Relationship Graphs (SRGs), which allow for a formal specification of tracking environments, and Spatial Relationship Patterns, which are used to derive data flow configurations by systematic analysis of the SRG. This formal framework supports a distributed software architecture, where clients efficiently produce, transform, transmit and consume tracking data, coordinated by a Ubitrack server.

Although AR's practical applications have not yet reached the level that many people involved in the field have dreamed of, the number of these applications is steadily increasing. Beyond what has been published about AR in the scientific literature and the lay press, current research in the field poses some exciting questions: What's real about augmented reality? What role does it play for all of us today, and what impact will it potentially have on society in the future? Will there be a killer app for AR, or will the AR bubble finally burst?

product attributes in a physical retail store with recommendations
for items only available online. The system supports users’ decisionmaking process by offering functions for comparing product features between items, both physical and online, and by providing
recommendations based on selecting in-store products. The physical products may thus serve as anchors for forming the user’s
preferences, also offering a richer and more engaging experience
when exploring the products hands-on. Both objective product attributes as well as the visual appearance of a physical product are
employed for generating recommendations from the online space.
In this way, the advantages of online and in-store shopping can
be combined, creating novel multi-channel opportunities for businesses. An empirical evaluation showed that the comparison and
recommendation functions were appreciated by users, and hinted
some possible benefits of a hybrid physical-online shopping support system. Despite the limitations of the study, there is sufficient
evidence to consider this a viable approach worth to be further

We show that the display types lead to different degrees of incongruence between the renderings of the virtual humans and the presentation of the respective environmental backgrounds, leading to significant effects of perceived mismatches as part of a plausibility measurement. The device-related effects were further partly confirmed by subjective misestimations of the modified body weight and the measured spatial presence. Here, the exceedingly incongruent OST AR condition leads to the significantly highest weight misestimations as well as to the lowest perceived spatial presence.

Science education needs to prepare students for a future world in which multiple representations are the norm and adults are required to  think like scientists.  Location-based augmented reality games offer an opportunity to create a  post-progressive  pedagogy in which students are not only immersed in authentic scientific inquiry, but also required to perform in adult scientific discourses. This cross-case comparison as a component of a design-based research study investigates three cases (roughly 28 students total) where an Augmented Reality curriculum, Mad City Mystery, was used to support learning in environmental science. We investigate whether augmented reality games on handhelds can be used to engage students in scientific thinking (particularly argumentation), how game structures affect students’ thinking, the impact of role playing on learning, and the role of the physical environment in shaping learning. We argue that such games hold potential for engaging students in meaningful scientific argumentation. Through game play, players are required to develop narrative accounts of scientific phenomena, a process that requires them to develop and argue scientific explanations. We argue that specific game features scaffold this thinking process, creating supports for student thinking non-existent in most inquiry-based learning environments.",,,springerlink:10.1007/s10956-006-9037-z,Journal of Science Education and Technology,1059-0145,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Humanities, Social Sciences and Law","University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Education, Curriculum &amp; Instruction 544B TEB, 225 N.

To this end, we present a user interface architecture that can form a sound basis for combining several of these concepts into complex systems. We explain in this paper the fundamentals of DWARF’s user interface framework (DWARF standing for distributed wearable augmented reality framework) and an implementation of this architecture. Finally, we present several examples that show how the framework can form the basis of prototypical applications.",,,sandor2005rapid,Personal Ubiquitous Comput.,16174909,,,,9,,3,,,1097,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of haptic (force and/or tactile) feedback has been proposed as a way to further enhance the performance of these systems. However, due to limitations in sensing and control technologies, implementing direct haptic feedback to the surgeon's hands remains impractical for clinical application. A new, intuitive augmented reality system for presentation of force information through sensory substitution has been developed and evaluated. The augmented reality system consists of force-sensing robotic instruments, a kinematic tool tracker, and a graphic display that overlays a visual representation of force levels on top of the moving instrument tips. The system is integrated with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) and tested by several users in a phantom knot tying task. The augmented reality system decreases the number of broken sutures, decreases the number of loose knots, and results in more consistent application of forces.",,eng,Akinbiyi:2006zt,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,1557-170X (Print),10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259707,,,1,,,,,,,,,,ar,17945986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259707,,2009-05-18 22:02:16 -0400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009-01-23 01:26:38 -0500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ppublish,Conference proceedings : ...

In addition, two other kinds of assembly support media (a paper manual and a tutorial by an expert) were examined in order to compare them with ARsembly. The results showed that the assembly times varied according to the different support conditions. AR-support proved to be more suitable for difficult tasks than the paper manual, whereas for easier tasks, the use of a paper manual did not differ significantly from AR-support. Tasks done under the guidance of an expert, were completed most rapidly.

Those interested in deploying these head-mounted displays need to understand better the effect technology has on the end user. One key aspect potentially hindering the use is motion sickness, a known problem inherited from virtual reality, which so far remains under-explored. In this paper we address this problem by conducting an experiment with 142 subjects in three different industries: aviation, medical, and space. We evaluate whether the Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality head-mounted display, causes simulator sickness and how different symptom groups contribute to it (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation).

The purpose of this research is to investigate the fundamental distinctions between AR and VR in the context of course instruction. Educators can acquire insights into how these technologies might be effectively integrated into the classroom by evaluating their specific traits, affordances, and limits. The research begins by defining AR and VR and then compares their key ideas. AR superimposes digital information on the real-world environment to improve the user's impression of reality, whereas VR immerses users in a simulated environment to create a sensation of presence and immersion. These contrasts lay the groundwork for comprehending their disparate uses in education. The study then goes into the educational benefits and difficulties of AR and VR. AR allows students to interact with digital information in real time, encouraging engagement, collaboration, and contextualized learning. It could bridge the gap between abstract ideas and real-world applications. VR, on the other hand, provides an immersive and regulated environment that allows students to explore complicated scenarios, imitate real-world circumstances, and acquire important skills in a safe and cost-effective manner. The research looks at the technology needs, accessibility concerns, and implementation techniques for AR and VR in educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of pedagogical design, content creation, and teacher training to maximize these technologies' educational impact. This review paper investigates the differences between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in the context of course education. AR and VR have emerged as significant tools for boosting the learning experience as technology continues to alter education. Understanding the distinct characteristics and benefits of each technology is critical for educators to make educated judgments about how to include them in their teaching practices.

Transfer printing of eight high-performance spin valve sensors arranged into two Wheatstone bridges onto 1.7-μm-thick polyimide foils ensures mechanical imperceptibility. This resembles a new class of interactive devices extracting information from the surroundings through magnetic tags. We demonstrate this concept in augmented reality systems with virtual knob-turning functions and the operation of virtual dialing pads, based on the interaction with magnetic fields.

However, relatively little is known about the potential of this technology to support teaching and learning with groups of young children in the classroom. Analysis of teacher–child dialogue in a comparative study between use of an AR virtual mirror interface and more traditional science teaching methods for 10-year-old children, revealed that the children using AR were less engaged than those using traditional resources. We suggest four design requirements that need to be considered if AR is to be successfully adopted into classroom practice. These requirements are: flexible content that teachers can adapt to the needs of their children, guided exploration so learning opportunities can be maximised, in a limited time, and attention to the needs of institutional and curricular requirements.",,,springerlink:10.1007/s10055-006-0036-4,Virtual Reality,1359-4338,,,,10,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Computer Science,"University of Sussex IDEAs Lab, Department of Informatics Falmer East Sussex BN1 9QH UK Falmer East Sussex BN1 9QH UK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When Augmented Reality (AR) experience is delivered on mobile devices it is termed as mobile augmented reality (MAR). MAR is state-of-the-art technology that has completely revolutionized the way of accessing and interacting with information thus invoking new experiences for users all around the world. This article is an effort to summarize the current research regarding user experience of MAR. Mobile AR Publications of past 10 years are identified for a preliminary review from prominent online databases and digital libraries. The aim of this study is to identify the areas of User Experience (UX) that lack research. We present a classification of present UX research in MAR domain. Research findings and possible opportunities for future research are also discussed.,978-1-4799-5813-9,,irshad2014experience,,,10.1109/IUSER.2014.7002689,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these apps are making information more ubiquitous without making the user necessarily aware of the data's origins, using graphics to represent multiple datasets. There has been however little research focusing on the trends in AR and the types of data visualisations used in mobile AR. The purpose of this paper is to fill that void by presenting an analysis of currently popular mobile AR apps on the market.

Shapes can be automatically assigned virtual content by classification according to a shape class library. Nestor performs shape recognition by analyzing contour structures and generating projective-invariant signatures from their concavities. The concavities are further used to extract features for pose estimation and tracking. Pose refinement is carried out by minimizing the reprojection error between sample points on each image contour and its library counterpart.

However, recycling also is a complex process, as each type of waste needs a specific recycling method. This comes along with multiple recycling containers, each relevant for one specific type of waste. Ensuring a correct recycling process therefore not only requires specific infrastructure, but also a respective attitude and knowledge of the population. Stressing the need for an accessible educational opportunity addressing waste separation, we present a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application that guides a user through a recycling process and hence scaffolds the learning of proper recycling of each type of waste. The app further provides a prototypical implementation of a product scanner, that identifies the waste type based on a marker and assists the recycling on a case-by-case decision. Using self-determination theory as a framework, we integrated gamification elements, aiming for enhanced need satisfaction, motivation and user experience. In a user study, we compared the gamified version to a control version, with both app versions yielding a high acceptance, user experience, and waste separation behavior. This indicates the importance of providing easy-to-use mobile apps allowing for a learning and assistance of proper recycling.",,,schaper2022addressing,,,10.1145/3546740,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a novel out of sight body-locked text placement for AR text presentation to be used in dual-task situations and compare it to head-locked text placement, each in two heights. AR reading affected performance in all tasks and reading speed was affected in all dual-task conditions. Participants subjectively preferred the body-locked text presentation, while objective measures do not reflect that preference. Differences between the tasks and several interaction effects between task and AR text placement demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the context of use when designing AR reading UIs.

To integrate AR in the everyday classroom, teachers need to be capable of designing their own immersive experiences for their students, which is why an analysis of existing authoring toolkits is necessary to identify suitable tools for educational application development and future research directions in terms of educational AR. We identified “easy access”, “GUI-based design”, and “interactive contents” as needs of teachers for designing AR content for the classroom. Based on these needs, we conducted a literature review of 835 documents. Of 80 relevant articles, we included 43 peer-reviewed articles from ACM Digital Library, DBLP, IEEExplore, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and miscellaneous other sources in our analysis. We identified 69 different AR authoring toolkits and classified these with regard to their accessibility, their degree of required programming knowledge, and their interactivity. The results show a divergent research landscape with a lack of empirical evaluation. Of 26 openly accessible toolkits, we identified five toolkits addressing the defined needs of teachers for designing interactive AR experiences for the classroom without requiring extensive programming knowledge. We conclude that there are only few tools for the straightforward design of educational AR experiences addressing the needs of teachers and suggest using research-informed and evidence-based criteria for developing AR authoring toolkits for education.",,,dengel2022review,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,,https://doi.org/10.3389/frvir.2022.798032,,,3,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such contexts, it is particularly important to display information without obscuring essential areas of central vision. Information can, thus, be presented to the peripheral vision. The objective of the present study was to investigate how peripheral visual cues should be displayed in AR to achieve efficient perception during walking. We conducted a pilot study and tested three different versions of directional cues presented while walking or standing still: simply popping up, moving towards the indicated direction, or changing color. The results indicated that the perception of peripheral cues in AR is generally less efficient while walking than standing still. Within the walking condition, the color-changing cue was perceived best.",,,Faulhaber.2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Konventionelle Anlernmethoden, bspw. durch Demonstration oder Arbeitspläne, haben Schwächen (bspw. binden sie zusätzliche Arbeitskraft oder sind kognitiv anspruchsvoll), die durch ein Augmented-Reality-(AR-)basiertes Assistenzsystem kompensiert werden können. Ein AR-Assistenzsystem zum Anlernen eines tatsächlichen industriellen Montageprozesses wurde in einer vergleichenden Studie mit 16 Versuchspersonen gegenüber einer konventionellen Papieranleitung evaluiert. Bzgl. Gebrauchstauglichkeit und Beanspruchung deuten sich die Stärken des AR-Ansatzes an. In den Subskalen Anstrengung und Frustration zeigt sich eine statistisch signifikante Reduktion der Beanspruchung. Bezüglich der Montagezeiten konnten statistisch signifikante Vorteile erzielt werden. Ergänzend wurde in einer zweiten Studie eine Videoanleitung mit der AR-Anleitung verglichen.
Praktische Relevanz: Die Digitalisierung der Produktion erlaubt nach Kundenwunsch individualisierte Produkte, die mit einer flexibilisierten Produktion einhergehen. Einfache Montageprozesse ändern sich daher häufiger vollständig oder in Teilen. Außerdem wechseln Mitarbeitende aufgrund der monotonen und repetitiven Tätigkeiten häufiger. All das führt zu einem Bedarf an regelmäßigen Anlernprozessen. Ein AR-Assistenzsystem erscheint als aussichtsreicher Ansatz, wobei die Gebrauchstauglichkeit besonders im Fokus stehen sollte, da wenig technische Kenntnisse vorausgesetzt werden können.",,,Hegenberg.2021,Zeitschrift für Arbeitswissenschaft,,,,,75,,4,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A generic framework is proposed which can generate, manage and reduce sensory conflicts at hand level while providing a continuous interaction cycle. Technically, the system is based on a video see-through head-mounted display that allows for embedding the real hand into a virtual scene and to visually manipulate its position in 3D. Two novel methods are introduced on top of this basis: an intuitive virtual object touching paradigm and a hand-displacement-based active pseudo-haptics technique. Both approaches are studied with respect to their benefits, limitations, effects on the behaviour of the user and consequences for the design of Virtual Environments. It is demonstrated that new forms of human-computer interaction are possible exploiting the described visuomotor conflicts of the hand. Promising future perspectives are presented.",,,pu08b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the study, an international sample of 1988 primary school students and 91 teachers used an AR-enhanced gamified STEM learning app (intervention group) or traditional teaching and learning approaches (control group). Student motivation and performance were assessed in a pre and post test design and teachers’ opinions were recorded using online surveys. The results indicate that students and teachers in the intervention group considered the motivational impact of the AR-enhanced gamified app significantly higher, compared to the ratings for alternative media in the control group. The product-moment correlation between motivation and further variables, such as student attitudes and self-efficacy, showed significant, medium strong results which are comparably high in intervention and control group. Only in the intervention group, motivation and learning achievement were correlated. Students and teachers in the intervention group tended to agree on the motivational impact of the study phase while a correlation between the opinions of teachers and students in the control group could not be confirmed. Overall, the study provides evidence of the pedagogical usefulness of AR-enhanced gamified STEM learning applications in terms of supporting student motivation, based on findings from a large international sample.",,,tiedeforthcomingstudent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, few studies systematically analysed teachers’ opinions and experiences about the advantages and problems in the educational use of AR technologies so far. In response to this desideratum, the following paper presents results from a systematic and category-based qualitative content analysis based on an interview study. The input was collected from a heterogeneous and international convenience sample of n=11 teachers after they had piloted one out of three AR-enhanced learning apps in their daily classroom practice. The results confirm that increased student motivation and classroom engagement and advanced learning achievements are considered the predominant advantages and that issues with software and technology were perceived as the biggest problems in the pilot study. Furthermore, dimensions of motivation and classroom engagement are considered in detail to achieve an in-depth analysis and to bring forward important recommendations for further developments and for teachers’ future educational use of AR technologies.",,,tiede2023augmented,,,10.21125/inted.2023.0369,,,,,,,"17th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED 2023)",,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,"Valencia, Spain",,,,,,,,,,,,,6-8.3.2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The studies compare several AR instruction applications on different display devices (head-mounted display, handheld tablet PC and projection-based spatial AR) with baseline conditions (paper instructions and phone support), both in a single-user and a collaborative setting.

                 limited workspace. In addition, registration issues are
                 also increased by the use of a mobile camera on the user
                 that provides a first-person perspective (1PP). Using
                 several fixed cameras reduces the registration issues
                 and, depending on their location, the workspace could
                 also be enlarged. In this case of an extended workspace,
                 it has been shown that third-person perspective (3PP) is
                 sometimes preferred by the user. Based on the previous
                 hypotheses, we developed a system working with several
                 fixed cameras that can provide 3PP to a user wearing a
                 video see-through HMD. Our system uses an ``intelligent
                 switch'' to propose our ``best view'' to the user, i.e.
                 avoiding markers occlusion and taking into account user
                 displacements. We present in this paper, such a system,
                 its decision algorithm, and the discussion of obtained

However, research on the use of AR in this context is very sparse. Therefore, we present a holographic AR mirror system based on an optical see-through (OST) device and markerless body tracking, collect valuable qualitative feedback regarding its user experience, and compare quantitative results regarding presence, embodiment, and body weight perception to similar systems using video see-through (VST) AR and VR. For our OST AR system, a total of 27 normal-weight female participants provided predominantly positive feedback on display properties (field of view, luminosity, and transparency of virtual objects), body tracking, and the perception of the avatar’s appearance and movements. In the quantitative comparison to the VST AR and VR systems, participants reported significantly lower feelings of presence, while they estimated the body weight of the generic avatar significantly higher when using our OST AR system. For virtual body ownership and agency, we found only partially significant differences. In summary, our study shows the general applicability of OST AR in the given context offering huge potential in future therapeutic scenarios.

Indeed, everyday walking in complex environments utilizes executive function, dual tasking, planning and scanning, all while walking forward. Pilot studies suggest that a multi-modal intervention that combines treadmill training to target motor function and a virtual reality obstacle course to address the cognitive components of fall risk may be used to successfully address the motor-cognitive interactions that are fundamental for fall risk reduction. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on fall risk.",,,Mirelman2013,BMC Neurology,,,,,13,,1,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exact measurements can be tedious, leading most patients to estimate their carbohydrate intake. In the presented pilot study a smartphone application (BEAR), that guides the estimation of the amounts of carbohydrates, was used by a group of diabetic patients. Methods: Eight adult patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 were recruited for the study. At the beginning of the study patients were introduced to BEAR in sessions lasting 45 minutes per patient. Patients redraw the real food in 3D on the smartphone screen. Based on a selected food type and the 3D form created using BEAR an estimation of carbohydrate content is calculated. Patients were supplied with the application on their personal smartphone or a loaner device and were instructed to use the application in real-world context during the study period. For evaluation purpose a test measuring carbohydrate estimation quality was designed and performed at the beginning and the end of the study. Results: In 44% of the estimations performed at the end of the study the error reduced by at least 6 grams of carbohydrate. This improvement occurred albeit several problems with the usage of BEAR were reported. Conclusions: Despite user interaction problems in this group of patients the provided intervention resulted in a reduction in the absolute error of carbohydrate estimation. Intervention with smartphone applications to assist carbohydrate counting apparently results in more accurate estimations.",,,Domhardt2015,Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology,,10.1177/1932296815578880,,,9,,3,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology,,,

The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and wordgesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.",,,kern2023input,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,1941-0506,10.1109/TVCG.2023.3247098,,,,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the first experiment 15 camera positions with five levels of height displacement and three levels of depth displacement were compared in four different tasks. Using a two-way ANOVA the comparison of the calculated performance characteristic values showed significant influence of height displacement on hand-eye coordination. In conclusion cameras should be placed above or below eye level, but by no more than 35 mm, in order to preserve hand-eye coordination. In the second experiment, a mirror system was used to check hand-eye coordination in an exemplary medical task allowing the cameras to be placed virtually at eye level. A significant decrease in accuracy was found while using the head-mounted display compared to direct view. Finally, the mirror system was compared to the 15 camera positions using the data from the same tasks. Significant differences in performance were found between the mirror system and eye level position as well as the position slightly below eye level. The results of the experiment provide design recommendations for developers and users of video see-through systems.",,,Park.2008,The Ergonomics Open Journal,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

                  with state-of-the-art mapping algorithms allows to
                  capture 3D point clouds with high resolution and
                  accuracy. The high amount of data collected with
                  LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM
                  approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data
                  for realistic rendering and simulation
                  problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to
                  be transformed into representations that fulfill the
                  computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In
                  this tutorial participants will be introduced to
                  state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing
                  and surface reconstruction with open source software
                  to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by
                  interleaved presentations, software demonstrations
                  and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point
                  cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d
                  trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in
                  C/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes
                  and other meshing methods will play another central
                  role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point
                  cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering,
                  segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface
                  reconstruction will be provided. Participants are
                  invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows
                  laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical
                  problems occuring when working with large scale 3D

Weiterhin haben wir gesehen, was Tracking ist und wie man damit Systeme aufsetzen kann, die virtuelle Objekte an der gewünschten Position darstellen. Mit anderen Worten kann man sagen, dass wir fast ausschließlich die Ausgabe von Informationen dargestellt haben. Darum befasst sich dieses Kapitel mit der anderen Seite, der Eingabe von Daten und Informationen in ein AR-System. Zuerst werfen wir einen Blick auf Arten und Möglichkeiten der Eingabe, um uns danach mit der Interaktion mit AR-Systemen zu befassen. Auch dieses Kapitel beschließen wir mit einer Übung.

Man neigt dazu, das Bild der Holobench aus Star Trek in die Realität zu übertragen. Virtuelle Objekte schmiegen sich perfekt in die Realität ein und sind nicht mehr von anderen zu unterscheiden. Die Zukunft ist nicht vorherzusehen, aber in den kommenden Jahren werden virtuelle Objekte noch als solche erkennbar sein. Sie werden nicht genau platziert sein, werden hier und da im Bild springen und nicht die plastische Tiefe von echten Gegenständen haben. Wie bei der VR sind die Erwartungen sehr hoch gesteckt und mit den in Augenblick zu Verfügung stehenden Mitteln nicht erreichbar. Es mag zu erwarten sein, dass die Kosten für qualitativ hochwertige Ausrüstung und der zeitliche Aufwand, um ein AR-System in Betrieb zu nehmen, in den kommenden Jahren sinken.

Landau et al. (2001) schreiben von über einer Million Montagearbeitsplätzen in der Fahrzeug- und Elektroindustrie sowie im Maschinen und Anlagenbau. Auch die manuelle Montage ist in vielen Bereichen der Industrie weit verbreitet, sie stellt einen wesentlichen Bestandteil der Produktions- und Servicebereiche der in diesem Sektor arbeitenden Unternehmen dar. Mit dem Aufkommen von Augmented Reality (AR) als neuer Form der Mensch-Rechner-Interaktion eröffnen sich Potentiale zur Unterstützung an Montagearbeitsplätzen, die sich auch auf die Arbeitsorganisation auswirken. Gegenstand dieses Kapitels ist die Untersuchung von AR-Systemen unter möglichst realistischen Bedingungen an realen Montagearbeitsplätzen. Im Gegensatz zu den bei Wiedenmaier (2004) beschrieben quantitativen Untersuchungen zur Einsetzbarkeit von AR-Technologien in der manuellen Montage und der quantitativen Evaluation von verbesserten Darstellungsmöglichkeiten von virtuellen Objekten gehen die hier gewählten Beispiele auf einem qualitativen Niveau einen Schritt weiter. In den beiden Montageszenarien werden alle Arbeitstätigkeiten und damit die gesamten Arbeitsplätze neu gestaltet und mit den zukünftigen Arbeitspersonen qualitativ evaluiert. Ein weiterer interessanter Ansatz ist der einer Produktion vorgelagerte Bereich der kooperativen Anlagenplanung. Dabei können Kooperationspartner aus verschiedenen, räumlich verteilten Unternehmensteilen oder einzelnen Unternehmen eine Produktionsanlage planen. Der Evaluationsfokus liegt im Bereich der Wirtschaftlichkeit eines Einsatzes von AR-Netcollaboration. Im Gegensatz zu den beiden Montageszenarien, bei denen aufgrund der permanenten Arbeit mit den AR-Systemen das Usability Engineering im Mittelpunkt steht, wird hier vor allem die Zeit- und Kostenersparnis in den Vordergrund gestellt. Dennoch darf auf bei der kooperativen Anlagenplanung die Benutzbarkeit nicht außer Acht gelassen werden.",,,Wiedenmaier.2004,,,,,"Fortschrittberichte VDI, Reihe 22, Mensch-Maschine-Systeme",,,,,,,,,,,ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They say you should never mix business and pleasure but in reality many of us find that we become friends with the people who we work with. No wonder, when you consider the hours spent together and the deep bonds formed through collaboration and sharing the highs and lows of the job.

A new study in Personnel Psychology is among the first to examine the effects on job performance of having more ""multiplex relationships"" – colleagues you work with directly who are also your friends outside of work. The researchers say these relationships are ""a mixed blessing"", but on balance they found that the more of them people had, the better their work performance as judged by their supervisors.

Centering a single element in a fixed area is easy. Just add margin: auto and a fixed width to the element you want to center, and the margins will force the element to center. There really should be a similar simple way to center multiple elements evenly spaced. It would be nice if CSS had a property called box-align which you could set to center then the child elements would be centered evenly within their parent. Well, you can achieve something similar by taking advantage of CSS's flexibity with recasting elements (for lack of a better term).",2012-02-13 14:18:44,2013-07-31 15:39:42,2,http://www.impressivewebs.com/center-multiple-divs/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent evidence documents the negative impacts of family separation on refugee mental health and concerns for the welfare of distant family members and desire to reunite with family members as priorities for refugees postmigration. Less is known about refugees’ emic perspectives on their experiences of family separation. Using mixed methods data from a community-based mental health intervention study, we found that family separation was a major source of distress for refugees and that it was experienced in a range of ways: as fear for family still in harm’s way, as a feeling of helplessness, as cultural disruption, as the greatest source of distress since resettlement, and contributing to mixed emotions around resettlement. In addition to these qualitative findings, we used quantitative data to test the relative contribution of family separation to refugees’ depression/anxiety symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and psychological quality of life..

Specific disciplines, such as economics, are not wedded to a particular side of the debate, and arguments for and against the use of patient values have been discussed at length in the literature. In 2012, Sinclair proposed an approach, grounded within patient preference theory, which sought to avoid a perceived unfair discrimination against people with disabilities when using values from the general public. Key assumptions about general public values that beget this line of thinking were that ‘disabled states always tally with lower quality of life’, and the use of standardised instruments means that ‘you are forced into a fixed view of disability as a lower value state’ (Sinclair, 2012)..

The study utilized a Mixed Method of analysis where the profile of fish farms and microbial quality of tilapia harvested from the fish farms were quantitatively described while a Focus Grouped Discussion was done to determine farm practices of the fish farm owners.  Interview, observation techniques and document reviews were also done to validate some responses provided by the participants in the FGD. Results of the bacterial culture conducted revealed the presence of different bacterial isolates from the fish samples which were found to be pathogenic and may be due to poor fish farm practices. Further, the results of the study showed that most fish farm owners do not comply to practice basic sanitary and hygienic protocols as endorsed by BFAR. While the bacteria load levels detected from the fish samples were within the acceptable limit as prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration of the Department of Health, some fish farms were detected to have high bacterial loads in as much as the harvested fishes from these sites are concerned because of the use of contaminated source of water supply. The study strongly recommends BFAR to conduct stricter monitoring and implement sanitary and hygienic practices in the fish farms of Cagayan to avoid food poisoning and intoxication once fishes like tilapia are consumed. Consumers are likewise advised to cook properly fishes cultured in fish farms.

Signs of Safety is a framework for child protection practice which aims to strengthen families through working in collaboration to identify their strengths. The review used a mixed method approach, which included an exploration of the mechanisms associated with effective delivery, and the contexts under which those mechanisms may operate. It considered : Effect; Mechanisms; Moderators; Implementation; and Economics. It also includes a summary for practitioners and an implementation summary for managers. Key findings of the review found little to no evidence to suggest that Signs of Safety is effective at reducing the need for children to be in care, reflecting a limited evidence base. However, evidence did suggest that Signs of Safety can lead to positive engagement with parents, children, wider family and external agencies. It also found that parents need to trust and collaborate with social workers if they are to develop a sense of shared responsibility for minimising risks to children. The review also identifies key barriers and enablers of implementation. Recommendations from the review include developing the evidence base for Signs of Safety and for the creation of a clear specification of what high quality Signs of Safety looks like in practice.

""I felt public charters will force (district) public schools to get better just because charter schools will show them what success looks like,"" Wisely said. Many people have misconceptions about charters, said Carol Lloyd, executive director of the GreatSchools national online rankings database. Some are high-performing, some are low-performing, some are run by large management organizations, and some are very small. There are schools that focus on STEM or performing arts, or have alternative instructional philosophies such as Waldorf and Montessori schools. ""The reality is that charter schools are more diverse as a group than (traditional) public schools, so you will find everything under the sun -- even a student who basically stays at home and works on a computer,"" Lloyd said. The California Charter Schools Association recommends closing charters that don't meet expectations for student achievement and other standards. One such school in West Contra Costa closed after test scores fell. But others are bucking the trend.

""Cottom worked as an enrollment officer at two different for-profit colleges, but quit because she felt uncomfortable selling students an education they couldn't afford. Her new book, Lower Ed, argues that for-profit colleges exploit racial, gender and economic inequality. Cottom tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that for-profit institutions tend to focus their recruiting on students who qualify for the maximum amount of student aid. 'That happens to be the poorest among us,' she says. 'And because of how our society is set up, the poorest among us tend to be women and people of color.' Though for-profit colleges hold out the promise of a better future, Cottom notes that the credentials they offer tend to be 30 to 40 percent more expensive than the same credentials from a nonprofit public institution. What's more, she says, students at for-profit institutions often drop out before completing their degree, which means many students are left mired in debt and with credits that are not easily transferable. 'The system that we've come to rely on to increase access to higher education to the most vulnerable among us really only compounds their poverty and their risk factors,' Cottom says. 'That's the exact opposite of what higher education is supposed to do.'""

The new battle plan includes pushes in Congress and before the Betsy DeVos Department of Education, plus two new lawsuits aimed at the regulation, including one, in Arizona, that has not been previously reported. It looks like this harmful effort is rapidly gaining traction. It took the Obama administration nearly eight years of battling well-paid for-profit college lobbyists and lawyers to finally enact and implement this regulation, which has a simple, common sense premise: Career training programs that, year-after-year, leave graduates mired in overwhelming debt should lose eligibility for taxpayer-funded student grants and loans. Career education should make people financially better off, not worse off, and the rule aims to channel money away from programs that do harm — and channel it toward those honest, effective colleges that are genuinely helping students build careers. For decades, many for-profit colleges, through a toxic mix of high prices, low quality, and weak job placement, have promised more than they could deliver, and yet have been getting billions annually in federal aid, much of it spent on advertising and profits, rather than education. Many veterans, single moms, displaced factory workers and miners, and others struggling to build a better future have been deceived and abused by unscrupulous college owners, whose offices are in Wall Street suites as well as strip malls. The final gainful employment rule does not demand much; only the worst programs flunk its test comparing graduate earnings with debt levels. The first round of results, reported in January, showed that 98 percent of the flunking programs were at for-profit colleges. The for-profit colleges have never stopped trying to overturn the rule, even after federal courts decisively rejected two separate industry lawsuits.

He said:""This hasn't been an easy decision as fire and rescue has been my life and has given me a more rewarding career than I ever could have hoped for."" ""I have had the privilege of working with many superb firefighters and support staff over the years and continue to be impressed with everyone who chooses to give service in this way. It is with very mixed feelings that I move on."" Jon, who will leave the county service on 1st February, added:""It's been a remarkable journey over the last four years and I feel that a good service is continuing to get better. I'll be watching with interest as GFRS goes from strength to strength."" ""I plan to continue working in the industry and to stay in touch, but right now it's time to hang up my boots. I am proud to have ended my operational career in this fine county and know our fire crews will continue to strive for excellence in these challenging times."" Cllr Will Windsor-Clive, Gloucestershire County Council cabinet member for fire, planning and infrastructure, said: ""Jon will be sorely missed by the service, the people of Gloucestershire and by me personally. His tenure at the top has coincided with some big challenges for fire and rescue services nationally and he has never shied away from his responsibility - leading from the front with tireless energy."" ""It is through Jon's leadership and the confidence he inspires in his staff that the county service is in such a strong, and much-envied, state today. I have no doubt that GFRS will continue to emulate his exceptional leadership in the future."" The council will communicate its succession plans shortly.

In the medical field, Mixed Reality systems can overlay real-time and spatially accurate results onto a patient’s body without the need for external screens. The complexity of these systems previously required specialized prototypes, but newly available commercial products like the Microsoft HoloLens make the technology more available.

Divided into three parts, interaction design, software design and implementation, this book brings together state of the art developments in the engineering of mixed reality systems, addressing issues at these three levels. Part 1 covers generic and specific mixed reality design elements and provides an overview of the design method; Part 2 addresses technical solutions for interaction techniques, development tools and a global view of the mixed reality software development process. Finally part 3 contains detailed case studies to highlight the application of mixed reality in a variety of fields including aviation, architecture, emergency management, games, and healthcare.

The industrial research project AVIGLE explores novel approaches to multimodal remote sensing by using a swarm of Miniature Un- manned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs), which are equipped with different sensing and network technologies. The acquired data will be sent in quasi-real time to a ground control sta- tion, where a VE will be generated automatically. Although this approach introduces a new low-cost alternative to the traditional remote sensing processes, it opens up numerous research and engineering challenges. In this position paper we introduce a mixed reality (MR)-based simulation framework, which has been developed in the scope of the AVIGLE project. The main idea for this framework is to create a con- trolled environment in which parts of the system are real, whereas other parts are virtual and can be simulated for testing purposes.

In this paper, we present the first experimental exploration of the effectiveness of mixed reality deictic gestures beyond physical gestures. Specifically, we investigate human perception of videos simulating the display of allocentric gestures, in which robots circle their targets in users' fields of view.

which involved a paper-based ‘history hunt’ around a castle searching for clues about historical events
that happened at the site. The clues involved people making drawings or rubbings on paper at a variety of
locations. The paper was then electronically tagged and used to interact with a story tent. This consisted
of a tarpaulin structure with projections on either side. A Radio Frequency ID tag reader and ultra violet
light were positioned inside the tent. When placed on the tag reader, each paper clue revealed an historic
3D environment of the castle from the location at which the clue was found. ‘Secret writing’ revealed the
story of a character at this location, while 2D images on the tent displayed corresponding scenes from this
historical period. Visitors to the castle over 4 days took part in this experience. Video analysis of children
and adults in the Storytent suggest that the quality of adult engagement reflects the extent to which
children discover and make connections. The importance of these findings is discussed in relation to
future design of mixed reality technologies to support collaborative learning.",1402013833,,stanton2003situating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our research outlines a number of key considerations for the design of time-critical emergency interfaces that led to the creation of HoloCPR, an MR application providing real-time instructions for resuscitation through a combination of visual and spatial cues. HoloCPR's comparative evaluation during a realistic resuscitation scenario indicates how the use of MR can result in decreased reaction time and increased procedural accuracy.

The focus lies on 3D point cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in C/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes and other meshing methods will play another central role.

While the potential of AR for applications such as geo-visualization has been shown using a number of demonstration systems, there are virtually no systems in daily use up to now. This is mainly due to technical reasons. Besides suitable displays, there is a lack of reliable and accurate tracking systems, which are however required for an exact registration of the virtual contents and the real scene. Additionally, there is a lack of experience and tools for the creation of mixed reality applications and often, of intuitive interaction techniques. Especially for applications involving public audience (e.g. exhibitions, museums, public participation), additional requirements apply, such as reliability, robustness, easy adaptation to different users, and the necessity for relatively low operating expenses. In this paper, we introduce the GeoScope, a mixed-reality input/output device, which addresses those problems, especially for public applications. The GeoScope is mounted at a fixed position and consists of a display, oriented towards the user, and a camera, which points at the surroundings. Just as a telescope, the GeoScope can be turned around two axes, the two angles being captured by measuring devices. Together with the known position, a fast and highly precise tracking of the current view direction is possible, allowing the superposition of the real scene, as delivered by the camera, and virtually generated information.",,,Brenner2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www1.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pub/haunert/pdf/BrennerEtAl2006.pdf

This paper investigates the impact of incongruencies on the sensation/perception and cognition layers to provoke breaks in plausibility, and the effects these breaks have on spatial and overall presence as prominent constructs of Virtual Reality (VR). We developed a simulated maintenance application to test virtual electrical devices. Participants performed test operations on these devices in a counterbalanced, randomized 2x2 between-subject design in either VR as congruent, or Augmented Reality (AR) as incongruent on the sensation/perception layer. Cognitive incongruency was induced by the absence of traceable power outages, decoupling perceived cause and effect after activating potentially defective devices. Our results indicate significant differences in the plausibility ratings between the VR and AR conditions, hence between congruent/incongruent conditions on the sensation/perception layer. In addition, spatial presence revealed a comparable interaction pattern with the VR vs AR conditions. Both factors decreased for the AR condition (incongruent sensation/perception) compared to VR (congruent sensation/perception) for the congruent cognitive case but increased for the incongruent cognitive case. The results are discussed and put into perspective in the scope of recent theories of MR experiences.",,,westermeier2023exploring,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG),1941-0506,10.1109/TVCG.2023.3247046,,,29,,5,,,,,,,,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increased cognitive and physical load during the simultaneous control of multiple game characters is counteracted by two features: First, certain game characters are equipped with AI-driven capabilities to become semi-autonomous virtual agents. Second, (groups of) these agents can be instructed by high-level commands via a multimodal—speech and gesture—interface.",,,2016:linkaa,,,10.1109/VR.2016.7504734,,,,,,,,,,,,,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to track users and objects above as well as on the surface. We describe the prototypical hardand

Particularly, mixed reality can help project initiators to visualize the planned changes to the city landscape in an easy and understandable way, enabling people to participate in a creative manner. However, this technology is challenging for most project initiators, as it requires an extensive technical and/or domain experience. Besides that, specialized hardware and experienced staff is required. An easy on-boarding process, which introduces mixed reality step-by-step and offers assistance by external service providers could promote both adoption and usage. In this paper, we present the design process and resulting concept of a configurator for a public participation platform, that aims to guide initiators with different levels of technical knowledge. Besides detailing the design and development process of the prototype, we will present the preliminary results of our evaluation. The interview partners provided positive feedback on the usage of our configurator. Moreover, different approaches are necessary for the public and private sector when configuring and purchasing their participation solution. Finally, we highlight areas that are still in need of further work, such as the compliance with the regulations for public institutions and address further promising areas of research.",,,schramm2022facilitating,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95531-1_19,,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering",422,,,,,,,,,,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examine two new modalities: gaze input and output in the peripheral field of view. All modalities are considered in the whole spectrum of the mixed-reality continuum. We show the added value of these new forms of multimodal interaction in two important application domains: Automotive User Interfaces and Human-Robot Collaboration. We present experiments that analyze gaze under various conditions and help to design a 3D model for peripheral vision. Furthermore, this work presents several new algorithms for eye-based interaction, like deictic reference in mobile scenarios, for non-intrusive user identification, or exploiting the peripheral field view for advanced multimodal presentations. These algorithms have been integrated into a number of software tools for eye-based interaction, which are used to implement 15 use cases for intelligent environment applications. These use cases cover a wide spectrum of applications, from spatial interactions with a rapidly changing environment from within a moving vehicle, to mixed-reality interaction between teams of human and robots.",,,Moniri18Phd,,,10.22028/D291-27053,,,,SciDok SULB:2018/Moniri18Phd.pdf:PDF,,,,,public,1b552f1d76c2847dd1ac62adfe0505d2,2018.02.01,flint63,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we propose a mobile mixed reality guide system for indoor environments, Chloe@University. A mobile computing device (Sony's Ultra Mobile PC) is hidden inside a jacket and a user selects a destination inside a building through voice commands. A 3D virtual assistant then appears in the see-through HMD and guides him/her to destination. Thus, the user simply follows the virtual guide. Chloe@University also suggests the most suitable virtual character (e.g. human guide, dog, cat, etc.) based on user preferences and profiles. Depending on user profiles, different security levels and authorizations for content are previewed. Concerning indoor location tracking, WiFi, RFID, and sensor-based methods are integrated in this system to have maximum flexibility. Moreover smart and transparent wireless connectivity provides the user terminal with fast and seamless transition among Access Points (APs). Different AR navigation approaches have been studied: Olwal 2006, Elmqvist et al. and Newman et al. work indoors while Bell et al. 2002 and Reitmayr and Drummond 2006 are employed outdoors. Accurate tracking and registration is still an open issue and recently it has mostly been tackled by no single method, but mostly through aggregation of tracking and localization methods, mostly based on handheld AR. A truly wearable, HMD based mobile AR navigation aid for both indoors and outdoors with rich 3D content remains an open issue and a very active field of multi-discipline research.",978-1-59593-863-3,,Peternier:2007:CIM:1315184.1315233,,,10.1145/1315184.1315233,,VRST '07,,,,,,,,,,,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,"Newport Beach, California",,,,,,1315233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paradigm shift is enabling capture of richer and more diverse data, combining elements from in-depth study of activity and behavior with modern sensors, and providing the means to accelerate sense-making of complex behavioral data. At the same time novel multimodal signal processing and machine learning techniques are equipping us with 'super powers' that enable understanding of these data in real-time, opening up new opportunities for embracing the concept of 'Data Science in the Wild'. In this paper we present what this transition means in the context of Health and Healthcare, focusing on how it leads to the 'UbiScope', a ubiquitous computing microscope for detecting particular health conditions in real-time, promoting reflection on care, and guiding medical practices. Just as the microscope supported key scientific advances, the UbiScope will act as a proxy for understanding and supporting human activity and inform specific interventions in the years ahead.",,,wish2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pervasive_sensing,"ubiscope, mixed-reality",

                  with state-of-the-art mapping algorithms allows to
                  capture 3D point clouds with high resolution and
                  accuracy. The high amount of data collected with
                  LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM
                  approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data
                  for realistic rendering and simulation
                  problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to
                  be transformed into representations that fulfill the
                  computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In
                  this tutorial participants will be introduced to
                  state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing
                  and surface reconstruction with open source software
                  to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by
                  interleaved presentations, software demonstrations
                  and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point
                  cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d
                  trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in
                  C/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes
                  and other meshing methods will play another central
                  role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point
                  cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering,
                  segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface
                  reconstruction will be provided. Participants are
                  invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows
                  laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical
                  problems occuring when working with large scale 3D

A user profile typically contains preferences, interests, characteristics, and interaction behavior. However, in its multimodal interaction with a smart environment the user displays characteristics that show how the user, not necessarily consciously, verbally and nonverbally provides the smart environment with useful input and feedback. Especially in ambient intelligence environments we encounter situations where the environment supports interaction between the environment, smart objects (e.g., mobile robots, smart furniture) and human participants in the environment. Therefore it is useful for the profile to contain a physical representation of the user obtained by multi-modal capturing techniques. We discuss the modeling and simulation of interacting participants in a virtual meeting room, we discuss how remote meeting participants can take part in meeting activities and they have some observations on translating research results to smart home environments.",,,NijholtZwiersPeciva09puc,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,1617-4909,10.1007/s00779-007-0168-x,,,13,SpringerLink:2009/NijholtZwiersPeciva09puc.pdf:PDF,1,,,,public,cbec3b9e8a3e8277d482dc1757ad76d3,2009.09.05,flint63,mr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
