    "Suchen Sie auf [bibsonomy](https://www.bibsonomy.org) mit einem selbst gewählten Suchbegriff nach Publikationen. Auf [bibsonomy](https://www.bibsonomy.org) lassen sich die Ergebnisse einer Keyword-Suche (z.B. [\"Bibliothek\"](https://www.bibsonomy.org/export/search/Bibliothek)) in einer Vielzahl verschiedener Formate exportieren (Limit ggf. vorher auf 1000 erhöhen) und lokal speichern. Geben Sie dafür einen Suchbegriff oben rechts in die Maske ein und bestätigen Sie. Rechts neben der Überschrift der rechten Spalte (\"publications\"/\"Publikationen\") klicken Sie ganz rechte auf das Symbol mit dem Pfeil nach rechts, der aus einem Kasten zeigt (\"export options for displayed posts\"/\"Exportieren für angezeigte Einträge\"), dann auf mehr/more. Wählen Sie ZUERST bei posts/Einträge \"1000\" aus, und wählen sie dann in dem Format drop-Down-Menü fast ganz unten JSON aus. Es öffnet sich die JSON Datei in ihrem Browser.  Sie können die URL wie im Tutorial über das requests Modul in Python öffnen.\n",
    "Alternativ können Sie die Datei auch lokal speichern. Dafür rechtsklicken Sie irgendwo, wählen Sie \"save as...\"/\"speichern unter...\" und speichern Sie die Datei unter einem passenden Dateinamen mit der Endung \".json\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Für eine Nutzung im zweiten Modulteil ist ein großer Datensatz sinnvoll.Fügen sie daher die Ergebnisse mehrerer Suchen mit Pandas in einem Datensatz zusammenführen. \n",
    "Fügen sie ihren Datensätzen dabei den Suchterm hinzu, der zu den Ergebnissen geführt hat. Tipp: Informationen dazu finden Sie unter \"Daten Verändern und Hinzufügen\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Nutzen sie dabei Python (vorzugsweise in einem Jupyter Notebook) mithilfe von Pandas. Sollten Sie Probleme haben, schauen Sie im Pandas Tutorial unter \"JSON einlesen\" oder bitten Sie Fabian Haak im Moodle Austauschforum um Hilfe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legen Sie Ihr Notebook bzw. Python-Script mit den Lösungen in einem \"Modul_2-1\" Ordner im eigenen Repositorium auf GitHub ab. Fügen Sie mich als zusätzlichen Collaborator (GitHub-Name: HaakFab) hinzu, so kann ich besser Feedback oder Hilfestellungen geben."

    "- Filtern Sie die Daten so, dass nur noch Einträge des Typs \"Publication\" enthalten sind.\n",
    "- Überlegen Sie, welche Felder Sie möglicherweise umbenennen wollen, und welche Sie nicht benötigen. Benennen Sie entsprechend um und wählen Sie nur die Spalten, die für Sie sinnvolle Informationen enthalten. Mögliche Änderungen der Daten sind das Umbenennen von Felder zu eindeutigeren Bezeichnungen (wie beispielsweise im Pandas Tutorial \"label\" zu \"title\"). Filtern Sie ihre Daten jedoch nicht zu drastisch und entfernen Sie nicht zu viele Felder, damit im zweiten Modulteil noch genügend Informationen übrig bleiben. \n",
    "- Wenn sie mehrere Suchergebnisse zusammengeführt haben, ist es sinnvoll, Nachduplikaten zu überprüfen.\n",
    "- BONUS: Wie bei den Jareszahlen ist es durchaus sinnvoll, zu überprüfen, ob alle Einträge \"sauber\" vorliegen. Stellen sie dafür sicher, dass alle Einträge Informationen zu Titel, AutorInnen und Veröffentlichungsjahr enthalten und dass das Jahr eine sinnvolle Zahl ist!\n",

Although that may sound like a simplistic definition, the things that can be created in a makerspace vary a great deal. Makerspaces can be high tech, low tech, and everything in between. A makerspace's offerings revolve around the needs of the community it serves, but the one thing all have in common is that they bring people together to share ideas. Typically, the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about mak- erspaces is 3D printing, but when it comes to what\\u2019s going on in makerspaces around the world, that\\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Makers create things, ideas, and concepts. Makers work in metal, wood, plastic, fabric, paper, and digital forms. From robotics to crocheting, there are no limits to your makerspace. Let your imagination run wild. In this chapter, we\\u2019ll provide the information and ideas to get your maker-spaces up and running based on your unique populations and budgets. You\\u2019ll find a myriad of ways to create your makerspace. You\\u2019ll also discover ways to ensure your makerspace is fun and functional.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"A growing body of research focuses on what outcomes to assess in makerspaces, and appropriate formats for capturing those outcomes (e.g. reflections, surveys, and portfolios). Linguistic analysis as a data mining technique holds promise for revealing different dimensions of learning exhibited by students in makerspaces. In this study, student reflections on makerspace projects were gathered in 2 formats over 2\\u00a0years: private written assessments captured in the 3D GameLab gamification platform, and semi-public video-recorded assessments posted in the more social FlipGrid platform. Transcripts of student assessments were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) to generate 4 summary variables thought to inform makerspace outcomes of interest (i.e. analytical thinking, authenticity, clout, and emotional tone). Comparative findings indicate that written assessments may elicit more analytical thinking about maker projects compared with less analytical conversation in videos, while video assessments may elicit somewhat higher clout scores as evidence of social scaffolding along with a much more positive emotional tone. Recommendations are provided for layering assessment approaches to maximize the potential benefits of each format, including reflective writing for social spaces, in social groups, and about design processes and procedures.\",\n",

Four objectives\\u00a0 guided the study: what constituted makerspace in academic library, the level of awareness of makerspace by academic library benefits and challenges of adopting makerspace in libraries. The descriptive survey design was adopted and questionnaire was used for data collection. The population of the study comprised of professional and paraprofessional librarians of Ambrose University and University of Benin, from which a sample size of 119 was drawn using total enumeration sampling technique. Out of the 119 copies of questionnaire administered, 94 were retrieved and analyzed using simple percentage and frequency tables. Findings revealed that, the respondents were aware of what constitute makerspace which are library space, 3D printers, computers and projector. It was also discovered that, the respondents had a high level of awareness of makerspace in the library. Some of the benefits associated with the use of makerspace are: it facilitates group interaction, it improves knowledge and provides access to wide varieties of tools and technology. Some of the challenges encountered in the adoption of makerspace are training of academic library staff, security of makerspace gadgets, poor funding, erratic power supply, high cost and maintenance of equipment. It was however recommended that; librarians should make deliberate effort to explore the potentials in makerspace in the enhancement of their services and training should be conducted regularly to enhance librarian\\u2019s skills in the use of ICTs Kingsley Efe OSAWARU, Angela Ishioma DIME and Emordi Herbert OKONJO 2020.

Substantial field work with students will also be required to see how far this professional lens has provided insight into how students are learning and supported in these and other makerspaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial implications\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wider cultural implications are examined, including the potential social value of makerspaces as transformative creative spaces empowering communities and individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginality/value\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first study to date on the potential educational value of makerspaces within HE, and the specific support academic library services can offer if they choose to host a makerspace (including teaching information, digital and critical literacies).\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Makerspaces have permeated public libraries for a few years now -- a trend that has been fundamental to encouraging community building and enabling technical and practical education for all. The public libraries in the Central district of Berlin are embracing this important means of training by not only offering two permanent Makerspaces in two of their branches, but also by introducing a mobile MakerBus which will bring different formats to the community where needed. This new expanded service will serve our users in different ways: one Makerspace will focus further on digital skills by offering drone building classes, 3D printing and robotics; the second one will focus on more manual competences like sewing, stitching and hand-lettering but also embrace technology by offering a low-level introduction to photo and film making. The MakerBus will combine the best of both Makerspaces, offering modules in 3D printing, programming, sewing, and on top a small mobile workshop for fixing bikes and small electrical items, encouraging responsible consumption and less waste. We truly believe that by investing in and expanding these services, the Central district of Berlin will present its library users with the best in digital literacy education resting on three solid pillars of learning.\",\n",

It is argued that current trends in society like DIY, sharing or the maker \\r\\nmovement have huge influence on the discussion of public library services in the \\r\\ndigital age. They also provide the groundwork for makerspaces and community \\r\\nbuilding as one of the main parts of future library services. This development is \\r\\ncombined with the urban gardening trend.\\r\\nOne main aspect of this thesis is the understanding, that urban gardening is an \\r\\nessential part of the digital age and not its counterpart. Urban gardening has lots of \\r\\ncharacteristics of the DIY and maker movement. Regarding urban gardening and \\r\\ncommunity gardens as makerspaces gives the basis to combine them with library \\r\\nservices. \\r\\nUrban gardening makerspaces are embedded in the ideas of the green library and \\r\\nthe sustainable library. Therefore, this thesis proposes a definition for ecological and \\r\\nsocietal sustainable library services. Afterwards the potentials of urban gardening and\\r\\npublic libraries and their role in urban development are highlighted. A guideline for \\r\\npublic libraries for creating their own urban gardening makerspaces completes this thesis.\",\n",

Public libraries hence need to demonstrate relevance to their communities, sponsors and other accountable bodies to avoid the continuance of this trend. This paper shows how libraries can link into debates in society and politics by adopting the urban gardening trend as well as developing new services around this green movement. Within the debate on public libraries\\u2019 transformation, urban gardening and the idea of the green library provide an opportunity to develop new green and sustainable library services. By combining makerspaces and community building with urban gardening and foodsharing, the public library of Bad Oldesloe developed a series of events that turned the library into a modern and creative learning space. At the same time, the library offered its physical space as a community platform for networking, cooperation and creativity.\",\n",

In fact, tighter budgets and the complex demands of both library users and staff call for careful preparation now more than ever. Whether you're building from the ground up or simply remodeling, the success of your project hinges on planning, coordination, and communication. This new update of Sannwald's classic guide will help you stay prepared and organized for every phase of your undertaking from conception through the dedication ceremony. Using a popular checklist format that ensures no detail is overlooked, this planner covers crucial considerations like Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) factors, structured to match the federal code; sustainable design features, including sensors that save energy and water; designing makerspaces, digital media labs, or leased library enterprises; disaster and recovery planning; creating quiet spaces; collaborative collections and materials-handling efficiency; and important virtual presence aspects to bear in mind during physical space decisions. Library managers, administrators, and facilities staff will find this book a matchless tool for any construction project regardless of size or complexity.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Zusammenfassung\\r\\nEs wird wieder gebastelt, geschraubt, gel\\u00f6tet, repariert. Werkst\\u00e4tten erleben heutzutage eine unerwartete Renaissance. Der Sammelbegriff \\u201eoffene Werkst\\u00e4tten\\u201c umfasst verschiedene Formen von\\r\\nInfrastrukturen zur gemeinsamen Nutzung von Mitteln f\\u00fcr materielle Produktion und den offenen\\r\\nAustausch dar\\u00fcber. Konkret handelt es sich um gemeinwohlorientierte Repair Caf\\u00e9s, Siebdruckwerkst\\u00e4tten und Fahrradreparaturinitiativen, aber auch um gewerblich orientierte FabLabs und Hackerspaces.\\r\\nDie gewachsene Bedeutung und die gestiegene Zahl der offenen Werkst\\u00e4tten sind Ausdruck und\\r\\nErgebnis sich ver\\u00e4ndernder Produktions- und Innovationsbedingungen in der Wirtschaft. Dezentralisierungsprozesse der stofflichen Produktion, die durch die technisch avancierten Auspr\\u00e4gungen\\r\\noffener Werkst\\u00e4tten vorangetrieben werden, k\\u00f6nnen sich auch transformativ auf andere Branchen\\r\\nauswirken. Entsprechend dieser Dynamiken wurden offene Werkst\\u00e4tten als vielschichtige Orte untersucht, um sowohl Nachhaltigkeits- als auch Innovationspotenziale in den Blick zu nehmen.\\r\\nIm Sommer 2015 richteten wir eine Befragung an 453 offene Werkst\\u00e4tten in Deutschland, um deren Innovations- und Arbeitsprozesse genauer in den Blick zu nehmen. Auf der Basis eines Datensamples von 103 Antworts\\u00e4tzen (R\\u00fccklaufquote 23 %) rekonstruiert die vorliegende Studie die\\r\\nsozialen, materiellen und \\u00f6konomischen Wirkungsprozesse in diesen Werkst\\u00e4tten.\\r\\nDie starke Dynamik des Ph\\u00e4nomens zeigt sich unter anderem daran, dass die meisten Antwortenden der offenen Werkstatt zwischen 2013 und 2015 beigetreten sind. \\u00dcber die H\\u00e4lfte hat ihre\\r\\nWerkstatt selbst mitbegr\\u00fcndet. Der \\u00fcberwiegende Teil besitzt eine naturwissenschaftliche Qualifikation.\\r\\nGemeinschaftsorientierung \\u2013 nicht das materielle Endergebnis oder die Herstellung eines Gegenstandes \\u2013 ist der Hauptgrund f\\u00fcr das Engagement in offenen Werkst\\u00e4tten. Die pers\\u00f6nliche Motivation der Aktiven liegt weniger im \\u00f6konomischen Bereich als vielmehr in der Vermittlung von Wissen, dem praktischen Arbeiten und in einer gesellschaftlichen Transformation. Das Erproben neuer sozialer Wege des Lernens, der Wissensvermittlung und des Zusammenarbeitens stehen im Mittelpunkt allt\\u00e4glicher Praktiken in offenen Werkst\\u00e4tten.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary\\r\\nLately, there is a noticeable trend that people start doing handicrafts again. And thus open workshops experience an unexpected renaissance. The term \\u201copen workshops\\u201d comprises different\\r\\nkinds of infrastructures for the shared use of resources for material production and an open exchange about it. This includes non-commercial repair caf\\u00e9s, screen printing workshops and initiatives for bicycle repair as well as commercially oriented fab labs and hackerspaces.\\r\\nThe growing number and importance of open workshops are the result of changing economic conditions for production and innovation. The decentralization of physical production, which is promoted by the technically advanced types of open workshops, may also have transformative effects\\r\\non other sectors. Multiple aspects of open workshops were investigated to assess the potentials of\\r\\nthese dynamics for sustainability and innovation.\\r\\nTo investigate the work and innovation activivties, 453 open workshops in Germany were addressed by an empirical survey in the summer 2015. Based on a data sample of 103 observations\\r\\n(which corresponds to a response rate of 23 %), the social, material and economic processes\\r\\nwithin open workshops have been reconstructed.\\r\\nThe strong dynamics of this phenomenon is demonstrated by the fact that the majority of the respondents joined the open workshops between 2013 and 2015. More than half of them are cofounders of the workshop. Predominantly, respondents have an educational background in natural\\r\\nsciences.\\r\\nCommunity-orientation \\u2013 not the material end result or the fabrication of an object \\u2013 is the principal\\r\\nreason for engaging in open workshops. The personal motivations of the actors are not primarily\\r\\neconomic, but rather directed towards the transfer of knowledge, practical working experiences and\\r\\nsocietal transformation. Experimentation with new social forms of learning, knowledge transfer and\\r\\ncollaboration is central to the everyday practice in open workshops.\",\n",

Their key success factors were found to include the abilities to leverage core capabilities and to overcome institutional deficiencies through relationship building.

The call comes from both government and private corporate circles, and it also emanates from enthusiasts for free and open source software (FOSS), i.e. software that anyone is free to use, copy, study, and change in any way. Ironically, rate of participation in FOSS-related work is far lower than in other areas of computing. A 2002 European Union study showed that fewer than 2 percent of software developers in the FOSS world were women. How is it that an intellectual community of activists so open in principle to one and all -a community that prides itself for its enlightened politics and its commitment to social change - should have such a low rate of participation by women? This book is an ethnographic investigation of efforts to improve the diversity in software and hackerspace communities, with particular attention paid to gender diversity advocacy.\",\n",

There has been a subtle yet significant change in the way human beings interface with their computing devices. The traditional standard of keyboard and mouse is not the only way we have to communicate with our computers anymore. We have entered the age of the personal digital assistant, which can deliver results with nothing but a voice command. Some of the largest technology companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon) believe that the digital agent will eventually be the primary interface we use to communicate with our computerized gadgets, the internet, and our network of interconnected devices (Internet of Things). With that belief in mind, these companies are attempting to make their version of a digital agent the de facto standard for most consumers. Each company is looking to establish a foothold in this marketspace because they believe digital agent technology is the key that will hold consumers in their respective digital ecosystems. In other words, once you use a particular digital agent and establish a connection with the software, it will be difficult to switch to a different digital agent. Essentially, if you were to change, you would have to start all over again.\",\n",

The virtual reality concept is\\r\\nfamiliar to us from online worlds, but our world as a virtual reality is\\r\\nusually a subject for science fiction rather than science. Yet logically the\\r\\nworld could be an information simulation running on a multi-dimensional\\r\\nspace-time screen. Indeed, if the essence of the universe is information,\\r\\nmatter, charge, energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the\\r\\nmany conservation laws could be a single law of information conservation. If\\r\\nthe universe were a virtual reality, its creation at the big bang would no\\r\\nlonger be paradoxical, as every virtual system must be booted up. It is\\r\\nsuggested that whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual reality\\r\\nis a matter for science to resolve. Modern information science can suggest how\\r\\ncore physical properties like space, time, light, matter and movement could\\r\\nderive from information processing. Such an approach could reconcile relativity\\r\\nand quantum theories, with the former being how information processing creates\\r\\nspace-time, and the latter how it creates energy and matter.\",\n",

Not many individuals, be that as it may, truly realize what VR is, the thing that it is fundamental standards and its open issues are. In this paper a chronicled outline of computer generated reality is displayed, essential wording and classes of VR frameworks are recorded. A savvy investigation of normal VR frameworks is done and finds the difficulties of Virtual Reality. Augmented reality, in which virtual substance is reliably planned with grandstands of genuine scenes, is a creating zone of natural arrangement. With the climb of individual cellphones prepared for making charming augmented reality conditions, the tremendous ability of AR has begun to be examined. This paper audits the present forefront in expanded reality. It delineates work performed in different application territories and clears up the leaving issues experienced when building extended reality applications considering the ergonomic besides, specialized confinements of cell phones.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Virtual reality simulation is increasingly being incorporated into surgical training and may have a role in temporal bone surgical education. Here we test whether metrics generated by a virtual reality surgical simulation can differentiate between three levels of experience, namely novices, otolaryngology residents, and experienced qualified surgeons.Cohort study.Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital.Twenty-seven participants were recruited. There were 12 experts, six residents, and nine novices. After orientation, participants were asked to perform a modified radical mastoidectomy on the simulator. Comparisons of time taken, injury to structures, and forces exerted were made between the groups to determine which specific metrics would discriminate experience levels.Experts completed the simulated task in significantly shorter time than the other two groups (experts 22 minutes, residents 36 minutes, and novices 46 minutes; P = 0.001). Novices exerted significantly higher average forces when dissecting close to vital structures compared with experts (0.24 Newton N vs 0.13 N, P = 0.002). Novices were also more likely to injure structures such as dura compared to experts (23 injuries vs 3 injuries, P = 0.001). Compared with residents, the experts modulated their force between initial cortex dissection and dissection close to vital structures. Using the combination of these metrics, we were able to correctly classify the participants' level of experience 90 percent of the time.This preliminary study shows that measurements of performance obtained from within a virtual reality simulator can differentiate between levels of users' experience. These results suggest that simulator training may have a role in temporal bone training beyond foundational training.\",\n",

The system implements an audience perception model controlling the nonverbal behaviors of virtual spectators, such as facial expressions or postures. Groups of virtual spectators are animated by a set of nonverbal behavior rules representing a particular audience attitude (e.g., indifferent or enthusiastic). Each rule specifies a nonverbal behavior category: posture, head movement, facial expression and gaze direction as well as three parameters: type, frequency and proportion. In a first user-study, we asked participants to pretend to be a speaker in VR and then create sets of nonverbal behaviour parameters to simulate different attitudes. Participants manipulated the nonverbal behaviours of single virtual spectator to match a specific levels of engagement and opinion toward them. In a second user-study, we used these parameters to design different types of virtual audiences with our nonverbal behavior rules and evaluated their perceptions. Our results demonstrate our system\\u2019s ability to create virtual audiences with three types of different perceived attitudes: indifferent, critical, enthusiastic. The analysis of the results also lead to a set of recommendations and guidelines regarding attitudes and expressions for future design of audiences for VR therapy and training applications.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is time consuming, costly, and of variable effectiveness. Training using a virtual reality simulator is an option to supplement standard training.To determine whether virtual reality training can supplement or replace conventional laparoscopic surgical training (apprenticeship) in surgical trainees with limited or no prior laparoscopic experience.We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and grey literature until March 2008.We included all randomised clinical trials comparing virtual reality training versus other forms of training including video trainer training, no training, or standard laparoscopic training in surgical trainees with little or no prior laparoscopic experience. We also included trials comparing different methods of virtual reality training.We collected the data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality of the trials, mortality, morbidity, conversion rate, operating time, and hospital stay. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis.We included 23 trials with 612 participants. Four trials compared virtual reality versus video trainer training. Twelve trials compared virtual reality versus no training or standard laparoscopic training. Four trials compared virtual reality, video trainer training and no training, or standard laparoscopic training. Three trials compared different methods of virtual reality training. Most of the trials were of high risk of bias. In trainees without prior surgical experience, virtual reality training decreased the time taken to complete a task, increased accuracy, and decreased errors compared with no training; virtual reality group was more accurate than video trainer training group. In the participants with limited laparoscopic experience, virtual reality training reduces operating time and error better than standard in the laparoscopic training group; composite operative performance score was better in the virtual reality group than in the video trainer group.Virtual reality training can supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training of apprenticeship and is at least as effective as video trainer training in supplementing standard laparoscopic training. Further research of better methodological quality and more patient-relevant outcomes are needed.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Virtual reality (VR) offers an appealing experimental framework for studying visual performances of insects under highly controlled conditions. In the case of the honeybee Apis mellifera, this possibility may fill the gap between behavioural analyses in free-flight and cellular analyses in the laboratory. Using automated, computer-controlled systems, it is possible to generate virtual stimuli or even entire environments that can be modified to test hypotheses on bee visual behaviour. The bee itself can remain tethered in place, making it possible to record neural activity while the bees is performing behavioural tasks. Recent studies have examined visual navigation and attentional processes in VR on flying or walking tethered bees, but experimental paradigms for examining visual learning and memory are only just emerging. Behavioural performances of bees under current experimental conditions are often lower in VR than in natural environments, but further improvements on current experimental protocols seem possible. Here we discuss current developments and conclude that it is essential to tailor the specifications of the VR simulation to the visual processing of honeybees to improve the success of this research endeavour.\",\n",

For example, multimodal interfaces or dialogue-based communications with virtual and real agents greatly benefit from the analysis of the user\\u2019s visual attention as a vital source for deictic references or turn-taking signals. Current approaches to determine visual attention rely primarily on monocular eye trackers. Hence they are restricted to the interpretation of two-dimensional fixations relative to a defined area of projection. The study presented in this article compares precision, accuracy and application performance of two binocular eye tracking devices. Two algorithms are compared which derive depth information as required for visual attention-based 3D interfaces. This information is further applied to an improved VR selection task in which a binocular eye tracker and an adaptive neural network algorithm is used during the disambiguation of partly occluded objects.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is an altered form of behavioral therapy and may be a possible alternative to standard in vivo exposure. Virtual reality integrates real-time computer graphics, body tracking devices, visual displays, and other sensory input devices to immerse patients in a computer-generated virtual environment. Research on this type of treatment for anxiety disorders is discussed in this article, and the mediating and moderating variables that influence VR treatment effectiveness as well. Evidence is found that VRET is effective for participants with fear of heights and of flying. For other phobias, research to date is not conclusive. More randomized clinical trials in which VRET is compared with standard exposure are required. Furthermore, studies are needed in which VRET is not just a component of the treatment package evaluated, but in which VRET should be assessed as a stand-alone treatment.\",\n",

Method: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials conducted that examined virtual reality applications in inpatient medical settings between 2005 and 2015. We used PsycINFO, PubMed, and Medline databases to identify studies using the keywords virtual reality, VR therapy, treatment, and inpatient.Results: We identified 2,024 citations, among which 11 met criteria for inclusion. Studies addressed three general areas: pain management, eating disorders, and cognitive and motor rehabilitation. Studies were small and heterogeneous and utilized different designs and measures. Virtual reality was generally well tolerated by patients, and a majority of studies demonstrated clinical efficacy. Studies varied in quality, as measured by an evaluation metric developed by Reisch, Tyson, and Mize (average quality score=0.87; range=0.78-0.96). Conclusion: Virtual reality is a promising intervention with several potential applications in the inpatient medical setting. Studies to date demonstrate some efficacy, but there is a need for larger, well-controlled studies to show clinical and cost-effectiveness.\",\n",

Participants performed a standardized familiarization session and temporal bone dissection task. Realism, training effectiveness, and global impressions were evaluated across 21 domains using a 5-point Likert-type scale. A score of 4 was the minimum threshold for acceptability.The experienced group comprised 25 otolaryngology trainers who had performed 150 mastoid operations. The referent group comprised 60 trainees (mean otolaryngology experience of 2.9 years). Familiarization took longer in the experienced group (P = .01). User-friendliness was positively rated (mean score 4.1). Seventy percent of participants rated anatomical appearance as acceptable. Trainers rated drill ergonomics worse than did trainees (P = .01). Simulation temporal bone training scored highly (mean score 4.3). Surgical anatomy, drill navigation, and hand-eye coordination accounted for this. Trainees were more likely to recommend temporal bone simulation to a colleague than were trainers (P = .01). Transferability of skills to the operating room was undecided (mean score 3.5).Realism of the VOXEL-MAN virtual reality temporal bone simulator is suboptimal in its current version. Nonetheless, it represents a useful adjunct to existing training methods and is particularly beneficial for novice surgeons before performing cadaveric temporal bone dissection. Improvements in realism, specifically drill ergonomics and visual-spatial perception during deeper temporal bone dissection, are warranted.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This article presents a novel method for controlling a virtual audience system (VAS) in Virtual Reality (VR) application, called STAGE, which has been originally designed for supervised public speaking training in university seminars dedicated to the preparation and delivery of scientific talks. \\r\\nWe are interested in creating pedagogical narratives: narratives encompass affective phenomena and rather than organizing events changing the course of a training scenario, pedagogical plans using our system focus on organizing the affects it arouses for the trainees.\\r\\nEfficiently controlling a virtual audience towards a specific training objective while evaluating the speaker's performance presents a challenge for a seminar instructor: the high level of cognitive and physical demands required to be able to control the virtual audience, whilst evaluating speaker's performance, adjusting and allowing it to quickly react to the user\\u2019s behaviors and interactions. It is indeed a critical limitation of a number of existing systems that they rely on a Wizard of Oz approach, where the tutor drives the audience in reaction to the user\\u2019s performance. We address this problem by integrating with a VAS a high-level control component for tutors, which allows using predefined audience behavior rules, defining custom ones, as well as intervening during run-time for finer control of the unfolding of the pedagogical plan. At its core, this component offers a tool to program, select, modify and monitor interactive training narratives using a high-level representation. \\r\\nThe STAGE offers the following features: i) a high-level API to program pedagogical narratives focusing on a specific public speaking situation and training objectives, ii) an interactive visualization interface iii) computation and visualization of user metrics, iv) a semi-autonomous virtual audience composed of virtual spectators with automatic reactions to the speaker and surrounding spectators while following the pedagogical plan V) and the possibility for the instructor to embody a virtual spectator to ask questions or guide the speaker from within the Virtual Environment. We present here the design, implementation of the tutoring system and its integration in STAGE, and discuss its reception by end-users.\",\n",

These surgical tasks were chosen as key steps in mastoid dissection because they were of intermediate complexity. Videos of virtual dissections were captured at baseline and again after practicing each task four to six times.OSATS scores for the tegmen task increased from 2.125 \\ufffd 1.25 to 3.1 \\ufffd 0.85 (P = .026), whereas for the sigmoid task scores increased from 2 \\ufffd 0.45 to 2.75 \\ufffd 1.125 (P = .0098). The time to complete the tasks decreased from 8.37 \\ufffd 4.78 minutes to 5.39 \\ufffd 3.06 minutes (P = .018) for the tegmen task and from 8.99 \\ufffd 6.7 minutes to 8.68 \\ufffd 5.98 minutes (P = .594) for the sigmoid task.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Surgical simulation is becoming an increasingly common training tool in residency programs. The first objective was to implement real-time soft-tissue deformation and cutting into a virtual reality myringotomy simulator. The second objective was to test the various implemented incision algorithms to determine which most accurately represents the tympanic membrane during myringotomy.Descriptive and face-validity testing.A deformable tympanic membrane was developed, and three soft-tissue cutting algorithms were successfully implemented into the virtual reality myringotomy simulator. The algorithms included element removal, direction prediction, and Delaunay cutting. The simulator was stable and capable of running in real time on inexpensive hardware. A face-validity study was then carried out using a validated questionnaire given to eight otolaryngologists and four senior otolaryngology residents. Each participant was given an adaptation period on the simulator, was blinded to the algorithm being used, and was presented the three algorithms in a randomized order.A virtual reality myringotomy simulator with real-time soft-tissue deformation and cutting was successfully developed. The simulator was stable, ran in real time on inexpensive hardware, and incorporated haptic feedback and stereoscopic vision. The Delaunay cutting algorithm was found to be the most realistic algorithm representing the incision during myringotomy (P < .05). The Likert and visual analog scales had strong correlations, suggesting good internal reliability.The first virtual reality myringotomy simulator is being developed and now integrates a real-time deformable tympanic membrane that appears to have face validity. Further development and validation studies are necessary before the simulator can be studied with respect to training efficacy and clinical impact.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Aerial photographs play a major role in current remote sensing applications. Traditionally those photographs were acquired using airplanes or satellites, and later manually processed in order to generate a virtual environment. Recently, Miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs) equipped with digital cameras have been proposed as inexpensive and more flexible alternative to acquire aerial images. The industrial research project Avionic Digital Service Platform (AVIGLE) explores novel approaches to remote sensing by using a swarm of MUAVs, which are equipped with different sensing and network technologies. The acquired data will be sent in quasi-real time to a flight ground control station, where a virtual environment will be generated automatically. While this approach has the potential to provide an efficient alternative to the traditional remote sensing processes, it opens up numerous research and engineering challenges.\\r\\nIn this paper we describe a virtual reality-based simulation framework, which has been developed in the scope of the AVIGLE project. Since the project involves a lot of risks, the simulation of the entire system in a VR-based environment is essential to create a controlled virtual environment that is independent of hardware, flight permissions and influences like weather and lighting conditions. During the project the use of VR is not limited to presentation purposes, but also serves as testbed to simulate and evaluate different hardware setups and software algorithms.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"To evaluate construct validity of the Voxelman TempoSurg Virtual Reality (VR) temporal bone simulator by determining whether generated objective metrics can distinguish experienced otologic surgeons from intermediate and novice surgeons.Prospective assessment study.Two university-affiliated teaching hospitals.Sixty-five participants were recruited; 40 novice surgeons, 15 trainees in otolaryngology, and 10 experienced otolaryngology consultants with a specialist interest in otology were individually assessed on a standardized simulated temporal bone task. The task involved identification and delineation of the sigmoid sinus in a virtual left-sided temporal bone.Objective data were produced using a scoring matrix incorporated into the VOXEL MAN TempoSurg software. The simulator measured the total time taken to complete the task, the volume and efficiency of bone removal and error data for excessive force or injury to the facial nerve, dura, and sigmoid sinus.Experts and intermediates outperformed novices with respect to the total time taken to complete the task (expert versus novice: p < 0.001; intermediate versus novice: p < 0.001), total volume of bone removed (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03), efficiency of bone removal (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001), time spent with the drill tip obscured (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001), and number of injuries to the sigmoid sinus (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The intermediate group injured the sigmoid sinus on more occasions than the experts (p = 0.008) and were less efficient than experienced surgeons (p = 0.005).Simulator-generated objective metrics can be used to differentiate individuals of differing levels of experience using a standardized temporal bone task. VR simulation has potential as a training tool and may have a role in both formative and summative assessment.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"We describe an augmented reality (AR) system that allows multiple participants to interact with 2D and 3D data using tangible user interfaces. The system features face-to-face communication, collaborative viewing and manipulation of 3D models, and seamless access to 2D desktop applications within the shared 3D space. All virtual content, including 3D models and 2D desktop windows, is attached to tracked physical objects in order to leverage the efficiencies of natural two-handed manipulation. The presence of 2D desktop space within 3D facilitates data exchange between the two realms, enables control of 3D information by 2D applications, and generally increases productivity by providing access to familiar tools. We present a general concept for a collaborative tangible AR system, including a comprehensive set of interaction techniques, a distributed hardware setup, and a component-based software architecture that can be flexibly configured using XML. We show the validity of our concept with an implementation of an application scenario from the automotive industry.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Virtual reality (VR) systems utilize additional input and output channels in order to make interaction in virtual environments (VEs) more intuitive and to increase the user's immersion into the virtual world. When developing VR applications, developers should be able to focus on modeling advanced interaction and system behavior instead of rendering issues. Many systems and tools for developing virtual reality applications have been proposed to achieve this goal. However, no de facto standard is available. In this paper we present Virtual Reality VRS (VR2S), a generic VR software system, which is an extension of the high-level rendering system VRS. The system provides flexibility in terms of the rendering system and the user interface toolkit. Thus, with using VR2S\\u00c2  rendering can be performed with several low-level rendering APIs such as OpenGL, RenderMan or ray-tracing systems, and the interface can be implemented by arbitrary user interface toolkits to support both desktop- and VR-based interaction. The proposed system meets the demands of VR developers as well as users and has demonstrated its potential in different planning and exploration applications.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper presents an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) therapy system for gait rehabilitation after neurological impairments, e.g., caused by accidents or strokes: The system targets increase of patients' motivation to perform the repeated exercise by providing stimulating virtual exercise environments with the final goal to increase therapy efficiency and effectiveness. Instead of simply working out on immobile stationary devices, the system allows them to walk through and explore a stimulating virtual world. Patients are immersed in the virtual environments using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). Walking patterns are captured by motion sensors attached to the patients' feet to synchronize locomotion speed between the real and the virtual world. A user-centered design process evaluated usability, user experience, and feasibility to confirm the overall goals of the system before any sensitive clinical trials with impaired patients can start. Overall, the results demonstrated an encouraging user experience and acceptance while it did not induce any unwanted side-effects, e.g., nausea or cyber-sickness.\",\n",

This study aims to determine whether there are any differences in performance of cadaver temporal bone dissections between novices who received traditional teaching methods and those who received unsupervised self-directed learning in a VR temporal bone simulator.Randomized blinded control trial.Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital.Twenty novice trainees.After receiving an hour lecture, participants were randomized into 2 groups to receive an additional 2 hours of training via traditional teaching methods or self-directed learning using a VR simulator with automated guidance. The simulation environment presented participants with structured training tasks, which were accompanied by real-time computer-generated feedback as well as real operative videos and photos. After the training, trainees were asked to perform a cortical mastoidectomy on a cadaveric temporal bone. The dissection was videotaped and assessed by 3 otologists blinded to participants' teaching group.The overall performance scores of the simulator-based training group were significantly higher than those of the traditional training group (67% vs 29%; P < .001), with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93, indicating excellent interrater reliability. Using other assessments of performance, such as injury size, the VR simulator-based training group also performed better than the traditional group.This study indicates that self-directed learning on VR simulators can be used to improve performance on cadaver dissection in novice trainees compared with traditional teaching methods alone.\",\n",

We hypothesized that both computerized analysis and expert ratings would discriminate the performance of novices from experienced trainees. We also hypothesized that performance on the virtual reality temporal bone simulator (VR TB) would differentiate based on previous drilling experience.The authors conducted a randomized, blind assessment study.Nineteen volunteers from the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery training program at the University of Toronto drilled both a cadaveric TB and a simulated VR TB. Expert reviewers were asked to assess operative readiness of the trainee based on a blind video review of their performance. Computerized hand motion analysis of each participant's performance was conducted.Expert raters were able to discriminate novices from experienced trainees (P < .05) on cadaveric temporal bones, and there was a trend toward discrimination on VR TB performance. Hand motion analysis showed that experienced trainees had better movement economy than novices (P < .05) on the VR TB.Performance, as measured by hand motion analysis on the VR TB simulator, reflects trainees' previous drilling experience. This study suggests that otolaryngology trainees could accomplish initial temporal bone training on a VR TB simulator, which can provide feedback to the trainee, and may reduce the need for constant faculty supervision and evaluation.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Measurements of physiological parameters provide an objective, often non-intrusive, and (at least semi-)automatic evaluation and utilization of user behavior. In addition, specific hardware devices of Virtual Reality (VR) often ship with built-in sensors, i.e. eye-tracking and movements sensors. Hence, the combination of physiological measurements and VR applications seems promising. Several approaches have investigated the applicability and benefits of this combination for various fields of applications. However, the range of possible application fields, coupled with potentially useful and beneficial physiological parameters, types of sensor, target variables and factors, and analysis approaches and techniques is manifold. This article provides a systematic overview and an extensive state-of-the-art review of the usage of physiological measurements in VR. We identified 1,119 works that make use of physiological measurements in VR. Within these, we identified 32 approaches that focus on the classification of characteristics of experience, common in VR applications. The first part of this review categorizes the 1,119 works by field of application, i.e. therapy, training, entertainment, and communication and interaction, as well as by the specific target factors and variables measured by the physiological parameters. An additional category summarizes general VR approaches applicable to all specific fields of application since they target typical VR qualities. In the second part of this review, we analyze the target factors and variables regarding the respective methods used for an automatic analysis and, potentially, classification. For example, we highlight which measurement setups have been proven to be sensitive enough to distinguish different levels of arousal, valence, anxiety, stress, or cognitive workload in the virtual realm. This work may prove useful for all researchers wanting to use physiological data in VR and who want to have a good overview of prior approaches taken, their benefits and potential drawbacks.\",\n",

To tackle this challenging issue, we conducted an experiment wherein participants learned an immersive virtual environment using a joystick. The following day, participants' brain activity was monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging while they mentally estimated distances in this environment. Results were compared with that of participants performing the same task but having learned the real version of the environment by actual walking. We detected a large set of areas shared by both groups including the parieto-frontal areas and the parahippocampal gyrus. More importantly, although participants of both groups performed the same mental task and exhibited similar behavioral performances, they differed at the brain activity level. Unlike real learners, virtual learners activated a left-lateralized network associated with tool manipulation and action semantics. This demonstrated that a neural fingerprint distinguishing virtual from real learning persists when subjects use a mental representation of the learnt environment with equivalent performances.\",\n",

In a formative multi-method approach, a total of 12 participants rated the general user experience (UX) of our system during body scan and VR experience using semi-structured qualitative interviews and multiple quantitative UX measures. Using body weight modification tasks, we further compared three different interaction methods for real-time body weight modification and measured our system\\u2019s impact on the body image relevant measures body awareness and body weight perception. From the feedback received, demonstrating an already solid UX of our overall system and providing constructive input for further improvement, we derived a set of design guidelines to guide future development and evaluation processes of systems supporting body image interventions.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this paper was to examine the effects of virtual play intervention on the level of playfulness of children with cerebral palsy. Thirteen children aged 8--13 years comprised the study group. Children attended eight one-hour virtual reality play sessions in which they were immersed and interacted with virtual reality. The Test of Playfulness (TOP) was used as the measure to assess playfulness. Participants were videotaped while they played during 12 different environments over the course of their intervention time. Three randomly selected virtual reality play sessions were chosen to score three different virtual reality environments within each session yielding a total of nine trials (environments) for each participant. The types of virtual environments varied across participants. Overall, the different virtual reality play environments produced varying levels of playfulness according to the TOP's four different subscale scores. Motivation ranged from 1.50 to 2.25, internal control ranged from 1.00 to 1.88, suspension of reality ranged from 0 to 0.26, and framing ranged from 1.33 to 1.78. The three environments producing the highest playfulness ratings were called Paint, Trip and Island Sounds. These environments allowed creativity, persistence with the task, pleasure, and a certain degree of control. Two environments did not appear to foster playfulness. A possible reason was that these environments were too unpredictable and frustrating for participants. These results will be useful for creating new virtual reality software applications that will encourage playfulness in children with disabilities\",\n",

The proposed procedure will evaluate the patient's response to the visual and auditory stimuli, provided via a VR device. We will highlight the functionality of the setup, its advantages and shortcomings, and discuss possible risks of the used technology. Our approach provides a complete virtual environment, including situations and combinations of stimuli that can test complex reactions of the patient, and, on the other hand, is completely under control of the neuropsychologist. We conclude by showing that the benefits of the approach significantly outweigh the downsides, so that the presented technology is not only a new opportunity, but also the future.\",\n",

Many challenges that educators face in online teaching can be addressed by using VR. VR can provide learners with an immersed environment where otherwise students cannot access. VR is an exciting way for turning ordinary classrooms into places of wonder, inquiry, and adventure. VR increases student's engagement and interest in learning. It makes many hard topics easy by 360-degree realistic view. This paper provides an introduction to virtual reality.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Technological advances in eye tracking methodology have made it possible to unobtrusively measure consumer visual attention during the shopping process. Mobile eye tracking in field settings however has several limitations, including a highly cumbersome data coding process. In addition, field settings allow only limited control of important interfering variables. The present paper argues that virtual reality can provide an alternative setting that combines the benefits of mobile eye tracking with the flexibility and control provided by lab experiments. The paper first reviews key advantages of different eye tracking technologies as available for desktop, natural and virtual environments. It then explains how combining virtual reality settings with eye tracking provides a unique opportunity for shopper research in particular regarding the use of augmented reality to provide shopper assistance.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Virtual reality applications employing avatar embodiment typically use virtual mirrors to allow users to perceive their digital selves not only from a first-person perspective but also from a holistic third-person view. However, due to distance-related biases such as the distance compression effect or a reduced relative rendering resolution, the self-observation distance (SOD) between the user and the virtual mirror might influence how users perceive their embodied avatar. Our article systematically investigates the effects of a short (1 meter), middle (2.5 meter), and far (4 meter) SOD between user and mirror on the perception of personalized and self-embodied avatars. The avatars were photorealistic reconstructed using state-of-the-art photogrammetric methods. Thirty participants were repeatedly exposed to their real-time animated self-embodied avatars in each of the three SOD conditions. In each condition, the personalized avatars were repeatedly altered in their body weight, and participants were asked to judge the (1) sense of embodiment, (2) body weight perception, and (3) affective appraisal towards their avatar. We found that the different SODs are unlikely to influence any of our measures except for the perceived body weight estimation difficulty. Here, the participants judged the difficulty significantly higher for the farthest SOD. We further found that the participants' self-esteem significantly impacted their ability to modify their avatar's body weight to their current body weight and that it positively correlated with the perceived attractiveness of the avatar. Additionally, the participants' concerns about their body shape affected how eerie they perceived their avatars. Both measures influenced the perceived body weight estimation difficulty. For practical application, we conclude that the virtual mirror in embodiment scenarios can be freely placed and varied at a distance of one to four meters from the user without expecting major effects on the perception of the avatar.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Several experiments have provided evidence that ego-centric distances are perceived as compressed in immersive virtual environments relative to the real world. The principal factors responsible for this phenomenon have remained largely unknown. However, recent experiments suggest that when the virtual environment (VE) is an exact replica of a user's real physical surroundings, the person's distance perception improves. Furthermore, it has been shown that when users start their virtual reality (VR) experience in such a virtual replica and then gradually transition to a different VE, their sense of presence in the actual virtual world increases significantly. In this case the virtual replica serves as a transitional environment between the real and virtual world. In this paper we examine whether a person's distance estimation skills can be transferred from a transitional environment to a different VE. We have conducted blind walking experiments to analyze if starting the VR experience in a transitional environment can improve a person's ability to estimate distances in an immersive VR system. We found that users significantly improve their distance estimation skills when they enter the virtual world via a transitional environment.\",\n",

Thus, rendering scenarios that do not interfere with such goals and deplete user experience is becoming progressively more relevant. We present a physiologically-adaptive system that optimizes the virtual environment based on physiological arousal, i.e., electrodermal activity. We investigated the usability of the adaptive system in a simulated social virtual reality scenario. Participants completed an n-back task (primary) and a visual detection (secondary) task. Here, we adapted the visual complexity of the secondary task in the form of the number of not-playable characters of the secondary task to accomplish the primary task. We show that an adaptive virtual reality can improve users\\u2019 comfort by adapting to physiological arousal the task complexity. Our findings suggest that physiologically-adaptive virtual reality systems can improve users\\u2019 experience in a wide range of scenarios.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Touch-sensitive screens enable natural interaction without any instrumentation and support tangible feedback on the touch surface. In particular multi-touch interaction has proven its usability for 2D tasks, but the challenges to exploit these technologies in virtual reality (VR) setups have rarely been studied. In this paper we address the challenge to allow users to interact with stereoscopically displayed virtual environments when the input is constrained to a 2D touch surface. During interaction with a large-scale touch display a user changes between three different states: (1) beyond the arm-reach distance from the surface, (2) at arm-reach distance and (3) interaction. We have analyzed the user\\u2019s ability to discriminate stereoscopic display parallaxes while she moves through these states, i. e., if objects can be imperceptibly shifted onto the interactive surface and become accessible for natural touch interaction. Our results show that the detection thresholds for such manipulations are related to both user motion and stereoscopic parallax, and that users have problems to discriminate whether they touched an object or not, when tangible feedback is expected.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In this paper we introduce new user interface concepts for fish tank virtual reality (VR) systems based on autostereoscopic (AS) display technologies. Such AS displays allow to view stereoscopic content without requiring special glasses. Unfortunately, until now simultaneous monoscopic and stereoscopic display was not possible. Hence prior work on fish tank VR systems focussed either on 2D or 3D interactions. In this paper we introduce so called interscopic interaction concepts providing an improved working experience, which enable great potentials in terms of the interaction between 2D elements, which may be displayed either in monoscopic or stereoscopic, e.g., GUI items, and the 3D virtual environment usually displayed stereoscopically. We present a framework which is based on a software layer between the operating system and its graphical user interface supporting the display of both mono- as well as stereoscopic content in arbitrary regions of an autostereoscopic display. The proposed concepts open up new vistas for the interaction in environments where essential parts of the GUI are displayed monoscopically and other parts are rendered stereoscopically. We address some essential issues of such fish tank VR systems and introduce intuitive interaction concepts which we have realized.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Effective data visualization is a key part of the discovery process in the era of \\u201cbig data\\u201d. It is the bridge between the quantitative content of the data and human intuition, and thus an essential component of the scientific path from data into knowledge and understanding. Visualization is also essential in the data mining process, directing the choice of the applicable algorithms, and in helping to identify and remove bad data from the analysis. However, a high complexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical obstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may exist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can perceive and interact with multidimensional information poses some deep questions in the field of cognition technology and human-computer interaction. To this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms for scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity hardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi-dimensional data visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their data and their colleagues in the same visual space. Immersion provides benefits beyond the traditional \\u201cdesktop\\u201d visualization tools: it leads to a demonstrably better perception of a datascape geometry, more intuitive data understanding, and a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Understanding how professional handball goalkeepers acquire skills to combine decision-making and complex motor tasks is a multidisciplinary challenge. In order to improve a goalkeeper's training by allowing insights into their complex perception, learning and action processes, virtual reality (VR) technologies provide a way to standardize experimental sport situations. In this poster we describe a VR-based handball system, which supports the evaluation of perceptual-motor skills of handball goalkeepers during shots. In order to allow reliable analyses it is essential that goalkeepers can move naturally like they would do in a real game situation, which is often inhibited by wires or markers that are usually used in VR systems. To address this challenge, we developed a camera-based goalkeeper analysis system, which allows to detect and measure motions of goalkeepers in real-time.\",\n",

VR is considered a particularly promising tool to support research and therapy in regard to distorted body weight perception. However, the influence of embodiment on body weight perception has yet to be clarified. To address this gap, we compared body weight perception of 56 female participants of normal weight using a VR application. They either (a) self-embodied a photorealistic, non-personalized virtual human and performed body movements in front of a virtual mirror or (b) only observed the virtual human as other's avatar (or agent) performing the same movements in front of them. Afterward, participants had to estimate the virtual human's body weight. Additionally, we considered the influence of the participants' body mass index (BMI) on the estimations and captured the participants' feelings of presence and embodiment. Participants estimated the body weight of the virtual human as their embodied self-avatars significantly lower compared to participants rating the virtual human as other's avatar. Furthermore, the estimations of body weight were significantly predicted by the participant's BMI with embodiment, but not without. Our results clearly highlight embodiment as an important factor influencing the perception of virtual humans' body weights in VR.\",\n",

Additionally, we considered the influence of the participants' body mass index (BMI) on the estimations and captured the participants' feelings of presence and embodiment. Participants estimated the body weight of the virtual human as their embodied self-avatars significantly lower compared to participants rating the virtual human as other's avatar. Furthermore, the estimations of body weight were significantly predicted by the participant's BMI with embodiment, but not without. Our results clearly highlight embodiment as an important factor influencing the perception of virtual humans' body weights in VR.\",\n",

Motivations for the use of social augmentations are manifold, for example, to synthesize behavior when sensory input is missing, to provide additional affordances\\r\\nin shared environments, or to support inclusion and training of individuals with social communication disorders. We review and categorize augmentation approaches and propose a software architecture based on four data layers. Three components further handle the status analysis, the modification, and the blending of behaviors. We present a prototype (injectX) that supports behavior tracking (body motion, eye gaze, and facial expressions from the lower face), status analysis, decision-making, augmentation, and behavior blending in immersive interactions. Along with a critical reflection, we consider further technical and ethical aspects.\",\n",

IVR is the advanced technology used in the model to give an experience to the people to feel a virtual environment as a real one and ANN used to give a shape for the characters in the virtual environment (VE).

Common solutions are based on specialised software and/or hardware capable of rendering 3D content, which not only restricts accessibility to specific platforms but also increases the barrier for non expert users. Our approach addresses new audiences by making existing Virtual Environments (VEs) ubiquitously accessible. Its appeal is that a large variety of clients, like desktop PCs and handhelds, are ready to connect to VEs out of the box. We achieve this combining established videoconferencing protocol standards with a server based interaction handling. Currently interaction is based on natural speech, typed textual input and visual feedback, but extensions to support natural gestures are possible and planned. This paper presents the conceptual framework enabling videoconferencing with collaborative VEs as well as an example application for a virtual prototyping system.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In visual perception, change blindness describes the phenomenon that persons viewing a visual scene may apparently fail to detect significant changes in that scene. These phenomena have been observed in both computer-generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper, we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic virtual reality (VR) systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for semiimmersive VR systems, i.e., a passive and active stereoscopic projection system as well as an immersive VR system, i.e., a head-mounted display, and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Interacting with the 3D content present in games\\r\\nand virtual environments generally involves some form of\\r\\n3D interaction. As such, the design and development of 3D\\r\\nspatial interaction devices are important in creating more\\r\\nrealistic and immersive user experiences in 3D virtual\\r\\nenvironment applications through natural and intuitive\\r\\nhuman expression. In general, current commercially\\r\\navailable 3D input devices for virtual reality applications\\r\\nlike data gloves, multiple DOF sensors and trackers, etc.\\r\\ntypically come with a heavy price tag. The objective of this\\r\\nresearch is to investigate an approach to setting up an\\r\\ninexpensive 6-DOF optical tracking system using Wii\\r\\nRemotes, which is adequate for 3D interaction in an\\r\\ninteractive Head-Mounted Display (HMD) virtual reality\\r\\nsystem. For the purpose of HMD virtual reality, a user\\r\\nshould ideally be able to use a 3D interaction device in a\\r\\nspace surrounding the user. This cannot be achieved when\\r\\nusing this game controller in the conventional manner. Also,\\r\\nnormal usage of the controller only allows for relative\\r\\npositioning and cannot reliably track 6-DOF. This paper\\r\\noutlines a method of using Wii Remotes for 3D spatial\\r\\ninteraction in an area surrounding the user. This paper also\\r\\npresents experimental results conducted in order to\\r\\nbenchmark the accuracy of the system, by comparing the\\r\\nsystem\\u2019s position and orientation estimates with the\\r\\nreadings obtained from a commercial 6-DOF magnetic\\r\\ntracker.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Welcome to the first Workshop on Software Engineering and Architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems SEARIS. We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systems\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics.\\nIn previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This work\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 mshop provides a face\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090to\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems RIS. Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as real\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepa\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current state\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090of\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090the\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sum\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 omarize the work our community is doing.\\n\\nArranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop\\\\u0027s goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections:\\n\\n* Systems.

      "    \"abstract\": \"This article investigates the effects of different XR displays on the\\r\\nperception and plausibility of personalized virtual humans. We compared immersive virtual reality (VR), video see-through augmented reality (VST AR), and optical see-through AR (OST AR). The personalized virtual alter egos were generated by state-of-the-art photogrammetry methods. 42 participants were repeatedly exposed to animated versions of their 3D-reconstructed virtual alter egos in each of the three XR display conditions. The reconstructed virtual alter egos were additionally modified in body weight for each repetition. We show that the display types lead to different degrees of incongruence between the renderings of the virtual humans and the presentation of the respective environmental backgrounds, leading to significant effects of perceived mismatches as part of a plausibility measurement. The device-related effects were further partly confirmed by subjective misestimations of the modified body weight and the measured spatial presence. Here, the exceedingly incongruent OST AR condition leads to the significantly highest weight misestimations as well as to the lowest perceived spatial presence. However, similar effects could not be confirmed for the affective appraisal (i.e., humanness, eeriness, or attractiveness) of the virtual humans, giving rise to the assumption that these factors might be unrelated to each other.\",\n",

By view management, we mean maintaining visual constraints on the projections of objects on the view plane, such as locating related objects near each other, or preventing objects from occluding each other. Our view-management component accomplishes this by modifying selected object properties, including position, size, and transparency, which are tagged to indicate their constraints. For example, some objects may have geometric properties that are determined entirely by a physical simulation and which cannot be modified, while other objects may be annotations whose position and size are flexible. We introduce algorithms that use upright rectangular extents to represent on the view plane a dynamic and efficient approximation of the occupied space containing the projections of visible portions of 3D objects, as well as the unoccupied space in which objects can be placed to\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper presents an image-based rendering approach to accelerate rendering time of virtual scenes containing a large number of complex high poly count objects. Our approach replaces complex objects by impostors, light-weight image-based representations leveraging geometry and shading related processing costs. In contrast to their classical implementation, our impostors are specifically designed to work in Virtual-, Augmented- and Mixed Reality scenarios (XR for short), as they support stereoscopic rendering to provide correct depth perception. Motion parallax of typical head movements is compensated by using a ray marched parallax correction step. Our approach provides a dynamic run-time recreation of impostors as necessary for larger changes in view position. The dynamic run-time recreation is decoupled from the actual rendering process. Hence, its associated processing cost is therefore distributed over multiple frames. This avoids any unwanted frame drops or latency spikes even for impostors of objects with complex geometry and many polygons. In addition to the significant performance benefit, our impostors compare favorably against the original mesh representation, as geometric and textural temporal aliasing artifacts are heavily suppressed.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper presents an image-based rendering approach to accelerate rendering time of virtual scenes containing a large number of complex high poly count objects. Our approach replaces complex objects by impostors, light-weight image-based representations leveraging geometry and shading related processing costs. In contrast to their classical implementation, our impostors are specifically designed to work in Virtual-, Augmented- and Mixed Reality scenarios (XR for short), as they support stereoscopic rendering to provide correct depth perception. Motion parallax of typical head movements is compensated by using a ray marched parallax correction step. Our approach provides a dynamic run-time recreation of impostors as necessary for larger changes in view position. The dynamic run-time recreation is decoupled from the actual rendering process. Hence, its associated processing cost is therefore distributed over multiple frames. This avoids any unwanted frame drops or latency spikes even for impostors of objects with complex geometry and many polygons. In addition to the significant performance benefit, our impostors compare favorably against the original mesh representation, as geometric and textural temporal aliasing artifacts are heavily suppressed.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Modern computer-aided design (CAD) systems and software tools have played a significant role in improving the efficiency of the overall product design process, ensuring geometric accuracy and the exchange of product model data.However, the impact of these technologies is largely restricted to the detailed modeling and engineering analysis that occur during the embodiment design phase. Conceptual design has not benefited from these sophisticated and highly precise software tools to the same degree because the creative activities associated with developing and communicating potential solutions with minimal details is far less formulaic in its implementation. At the early stages of product design the specifications and constraints have not been fully established. The industrial designers and engineers need the freedom to change and modify the product configuration and mechanical behavior to investigate a wide range of alternative solutions. Any CAD system that seeks to support and enhance conceptual design must, therefore, enable natural and haptic modes of human-computer interaction. Recent advancements in high-\\r\\nspeed, multi-core computer hardware and virtual reality (VR) technology provide opportunities to link the more fluid\\r\\nprocesses of creative conceptual design with the rigidly defined tasks of product detailing and engineering analysis. This paper\\r\\ndiscusses the role that virtual reality can play for concept\\r\\ndesign module.\",\n",

After receiving the same didactic teaching they were randomized into two groups. The traditional group were to receive addition teaching via traditional teaching methods such as small group tutorials, videos, and models. The VR group received supervised teaching on the VR simulator. At the end of their teaching they were asked to perform a cadaveric temporal bone dissection and had their performance videoed and assessed by blinded assessors. The assessors judged the videos on four domains of assessments looking at the end product, injury size, overall performance, and technique. These assessments were based on the Welling's scale and OSATS.The VR group performed significantly better in the end product of the dissection (VR 80% vs. traditional 45%, P-value <.001) and caused smaller injuries to anatomic structures (VR 19% vs. traditional 36%, P-value = .01). They also did better in the overall performance score (VR 55% vs. traditional 35%, P-value = .04) There were no differences in the technique score. There was a fair to moderate degree of interrater reliability between the assessors (kappa = 0.33-0.47; Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.34-0.76).Supervised teaching using a VR simulator seems to improve cadaveric temporal bone dissection performance compared with traditional teaching methods.\",\n",

However, related research concerning technology integration in the classroom has shown that a valuable medium alone does not automatically lead to its successful use. It is therefore the aim of the paper to present an approach by which competencies of pre-service teachers for a successful and appropriate integration of Augmented and Virtual Reality-applications in the classroom are fostered - the own design of Augmented and Virtual Reality applications. We will begin with a short discussion of prominent findings and related work in regard to teaching and learning with and about Augmented and Virtual Reality in the first part before introducing the main goals and aspects of the presented pedagogical concept and the seminar in the second part of the paper. In the third part, two applications created in the seminar and qualitative data from an explorative study based on focus group interviews and participant observation will be presented. We close with a discussion of our findings and an outlook to future work.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"We present Redgraph, the first generic virtual reality visualization program for Semantic Web data. Redgraph is capable of handling large data-sets, as we demonstrate on social network data from the U.S. Patent Trade Office. We develop a Semantic Web vocabulary of virtual reality terms compatible with GraphXML to map graph visualization into the Semantic Web itself. Our approach to visualizing Semantic Web data takes advantage of user-interaction in an immersive environment to bypass a number of difficult issues in 3-dimensional graph visualization layout by relying on users themselves to interactively extrude the nodes and links of a 2-dimensional graph into the third dimension. When users touch nodes in the virtual reality environment, they retrieve data formatted according to the data\\u2019s schema or ontology. We applied Redgraph to social network data constructed from patents, inventors, and institutions from the United States Patent and Trademark Office in order to explore networks of innovation in computing. Using this data-set, results of a user study comparing extrusion (3-D) vs. no-extrusion (2-D) are presented. The study showed the use of a 3-D interface by subjects led to significant improvement on answering of fine-grained questions about the data-set, but no significant difference was found for broad questions about the overall structure of the data. Furthermore, inference can be used to improve the visualization, as demonstrated with a data-set of biotechnology patents and researchers.\",\n",

Various relevant constructs and their measurement factors were identified to examine how desktop VR enhances learning and the fit of the hypothesized model was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results supported the indirect effect of VR features to the learning outcomes, which was mediated by the interaction experience and the learning experience. Learning experience which was individually measured by the psychological factors, that is, presence, motivation, cognitive benefits, control and active learning, and reflective thinking took central stage in affecting the learning outcomes in the desktop VR-based learning environment. The moderating effect of student characteristics such as spatial ability and learning style was also examined. The results show instructional designers and VR software developers how to improve the learning effectiveness and further strengthen their desktop VR-based learning implementation. Through this research, an initial theoretical model of the determinants of learning effectiveness in a desktop VR-based learning environment is contributed.\",\n",

VR applications provide a broad design space which includes contextual aspects of the virtual surroundings as well as user-driven deliberate choices of their appearance in VR potentially influencing VBO and other well-known effects of VR. We propose a protocol for an experiment to investigate the influence of deliberateness and context-match on VBO and presence. In a first study, we found significant interactions with the environment. Based on our results we derive recommendations for future experiments.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Virtual reality based geographic information systems (VRGIS) have been successfully employed for urban planning and architectural design in recent years. Tracking technologies and stereoscopic visualization of three-dimensional structures allow a better insight into complex datasets. Unfortunately, these systems often lack intuitive interaction concepts and therefore reduce VRGIS to advanced visualization environments, since manipulation of the content is not or only rudimentarily possible. In this paper, we present a geographic information system for urban planning tasks in semi-immersive virtual reality (VR) systems. The objective of this approach is to provide professional city planners with an enhanced VR interface, which enables comfortable interaction concepts similar to the interactions of the real-world planning task. To assure the usability and relevance of the developed system, urban planners have cooperated closely in the development process.\\r\\nIn this paper both the hard- and software architecture of the entire system as well as VR related interaction metaphors and their evaluation are discussed.\",\n",

An intuitive, two dimensional visibility measure based on the concept of solid angle is developed. We determine to which extent an object of interest, observed by a user, intersects with each region of the underlying visual field model. The results are weighted (thereby considering the visual acuity in each visual field) to determine the total visibility of the object. As a proof of concept, we exemplify the proposed model in a virtual reality application which incorporates a head-mounted display with integrated eye tracking functionality. In this context, we implement several proactive system behaviors including contextual information presentation with an adaptive level of detail and attention guidance; the latter is implemented by detecting visual acuity limitations or attention drifts.\",\n",

We focus on the influence of avatar embodiment, visual fidelity, motion perception, and body representation. We summarize findings on the impact of these factors on time perception, discuss lessons learned, and implications for future applications. \\r\\nIn a waiting room experiment, the passage of time in VR with an avatar was perceived significantly faster than without an avatar. The passage of time in the real waiting room was not perceived as significantly different from the waiting room in VR with or without an avatar.\\r\\nIn an interactive scenario, the absence of a virtual avatar resulted in a significantly slower perceived passage of time compared to the partial and full-body avatar conditions. High and medium embodiment conditions are assumed to be more plausible and to less different from a real experience. \\r\\nA virtual tunnel that induced the illusion of self-motion (vection) appeared to contribute to the perceived passage of time and experience of time. This effect was shown to increase with tunnel speed and the number of tunnel segments. \\r\\nA framework was proposed for the use of virtual zeitgebers along three dimensions (speed, density, synchronicity) to systematically control the experience of time. The body itself, as well as external objects, seem to be addressed by this theory of virtual zeitgebers. \\r\\nFinally, the standardization of the methodology and future research considerations are discussed.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this paper was to examine the effects of virtual play intervention on the level of playfulness of children with cerebral palsy. Thirteen children aged 8-13 years comprised the study group. Children attended eight one-hour virtual reality play sessions in which they were immersed and interacted with virtual reality. The Test of Playfulness (TOP) was used as the measure to assess playfulness. Participants were videotaped while they played during 12 different environments over the course of their intervention time. Three randomly selected virtual reality play sessions were chosen to score three different virtual reality environments within each session yielding a total of nine trials (environments) for each participant. The types of virtual environments varied across participants. Overall, the different virtual reality play environments produced varying levels of playfulness according to the TOP's four different subscale scores. Motivation ranged from 1.50 to 2.25, internal control ranged from 1.00 to 1.88, suspension of reality ranged from 0 to 0.26, and framing ranged from 1.33 to 1.78. The three environments producing the highest playfulness ratings were called Paint, Trip and Island Sounds. These environments allowed creativity, persistence with the task, pleasure, and a certain degree of control. Two environments did not appear to foster playfulness. A possible reason was that these environments were too unpredictable and frustrating for participants. These results will be useful for creating new virtual reality software applications that will encourage playfulness in children with disabilities.\",\n",

It is particulary designed for its use in Virtual Reality (VR) applications and contains an abstraction layer for different sensor hardware. Using the framework, gestures are described by their characteristic spatio-temporal features which are on the lowest level calculated by simple predefined detector modules or nodes. These nodes can be connected by a data routing mechanism to perform more elaborate evaluation functions, therewith establishing complex detector nets.

      "    \"abstract\": \"This article presents a gesture detection and analysis framework for modelling multimodal interactions. It is particulary designed for its use in Virtual Reality (VR) applications and contains an abstraction layer for different sensor hardware. Using the framework, gestures are described by their characteristic spatio-temporal features which are on the lowest level calculated by simple predefined detector modules or nodes. These nodes can be connected by a data routing mechanism to perform more elaborate evaluation functions, therewith establishing complex detector nets. Typical problems that arise from the time-dependent invalidation of multimodal utterances under immersive conditions lead to the development of pre-evaluation concepts that as well support their integration into scene graph based systems to support traversal-type access. Examples of realized interactions illustrate applications which make use of the described concepts.\",\n",

Users must recall the spatial layout of the real surroundings and grope around to find the physical objects.

These biases can also lead to the general tendency to avoid encounters with foreigners, which has a critical impact on society as a whole. This paper presents an approach to reduce implicit and explicit racial bias using two Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) in Virtual Reality (VR). Based on previous research from social psychology and the field of enculturated IVAs, a sympathetic East African-German mixed-cultural IVA, and an antipathetic German mono-cultural IVA were implemented to interact with the participants in a virtual pub quiz. Pre- and post-intervention measures of participants' implicit and explicit bias showed a significant decrease in both scores. This work demonstrates the capability of enculturated IVAs to reduce real-world racial biases and sets the base for cultural interventions with IVAs.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are two developing technologies with enormous promise to change the way education is provided. The purpose of this research is to investigate the fundamental distinctions between AR and VR in the context of course instruction. Educators can acquire insights into how these technologies might be effectively integrated into the classroom by evaluating their specific traits, affordances, and limits. The research begins by defining AR and VR and then compares their key ideas. AR superimposes digital information on the real-world environment to improve the user's impression of reality, whereas VR immerses users in a simulated environment to create a sensation of presence and immersion. These contrasts lay the groundwork for comprehending their disparate uses in education. The study then goes into the educational benefits and difficulties of AR and VR. AR allows students to interact with digital information in real time, encouraging engagement, collaboration, and contextualized learning. It could bridge the gap between abstract ideas and real-world applications. VR, on the other hand, provides an immersive and regulated environment that allows students to explore complicated scenarios, imitate real-world circumstances, and acquire important skills in a safe and cost-effective manner. The research looks at the technology needs, accessibility concerns, and implementation techniques for AR and VR in educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of pedagogical design, content creation, and teacher training to maximize these technologies' educational impact. This review paper investigates the differences between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in the context of course education. AR and VR have emerged as significant tools for boosting the learning experience as technology continues to alter education. Understanding the distinct characteristics and benefits of each technology is critical for educators to make educated judgments about how to include them in their teaching practices. This paper examines AR and VR in depth, concentrating on their distinctions, uses, and possible influence in educational contexts.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The design and evaluation of assisting technologies to support behavior change processes have become an essential topic within the field of human-computer interaction research in general and the field of immersive intervention technologies in particular. The mechanisms and success of behavior change techniques and interventions are broadly investigated in the field of psychology. However, it is not always easy to adapt these psychological findings to the context of immersive technologies. The lack of theoretical foundation also leads to a lack of explanation as to why and how immersive interventions support behavior change processes. The Behavioral Framework for immersive Technologies (BehaveFIT) addresses this lack by 1) presenting an intelligible categorization and condensation of psychological barriers and immersive features, by 2) suggesting a mapping that shows why and how immersive technologies can help to overcome barriers and finally by 3) proposing a generic prediction path that enables a structured, theory-based approach to the development and evaluation of immersive interventions. These three steps explain how BehaveFIT can be used, and include guiding questions for each step. Further, two use cases illustrate the usage of BehaveFIT. Thus, the present paper contributes to guidance for immersive intervention design and evaluation, showing that immersive interventions support behavior change processes and explain and predict 'why' and 'how' immersive interventions can bridge the intention-behavior-gap.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Navigation through immersive virtual environments is a key concept for virtual reality as it allows users to explore those environments. Therefore, it is important to understand virtual reality navigation interfaces and their impact on the users\\u2019 experience. This paper presents an objective performance evaluation of two types of navigation: natural (real walking and walk-in-place) vs. unnatural (gamepad). Steering Law was the objective performance metric chosen since it captures the relationship between the time to travel a path and the difficulty of that path. In addition to performance, subjective metrics were also considered, namely the feeling of presence, cybersickness and user satisfaction. The experiments consisted of having participants complete a series of paths with different indexes of difficulty and the time that a participant took to walk each path was measured. Overall results show that the navigation through real walking yielded better results when it comes to performance, cybersickness, and user satisfaction than the walk-in-place and gamepad navigation interfaces.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper provides a multi-disciplinary overview of the research issues and achievements in the field of Big Data and its visualization techniques and tools. The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.\",\n",

We present our preliminary ideas on surface interaction with stereoscopic data as well as our work on mobile camera-projector units. While the first line of research tries to increase the degree of the interaction experience in virtual worlds, the second uses the physical properties of the real world to enhance the augmented reality experience. The first idea uses the physical world to constraint the interaction in the virtual world.

The benefits of introducing virtual reality (VR) technology to enhance the rehabilitation services of post stroke patients are studied. A VR walking game for patients recovering from strokes was developed. Twenty physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and prosthetic-orthotic therapists were invited to evaluate the benefits of the games through questionnaires and interviews. Eighty percents of the therapists agreed or strongly agreed that the introduction of the VR walking game could help them to care for more post-stroke patients. The first prototype used a head-mounted display (HMD) to present the VR simulation and 12 therapists reported that the quality of HMD would cause potential disorientations in elderly patients. A second prototype with three panel-mounted displays was developed and results of further evaluation confirmed that the potential benefits of VR games in clinical management of patients recovering from strokes. Specific technical recommendations concerning an ideal VR game for rehabilitation are reported.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Objective To assess the effect of virtual reality training on an actual laparoscopic operation.  Design Prospective randomised controlled and blinded trial.  Setting Seven gynaecological departments in the Zeeland region of Denmark.  Participants 24 first and second year registrars specialising in gynaecology and obstetrics.  Interventions Proficiency based virtual reality simulator training in laparoscopic salpingectomy and standard clinical education (controls).  Main outcome measure The main outcome measure was technical performance assessed by two independent observers blinded to trainee and training status using a previously validated general and task specific rating scale. The secondary outcome measure was operation time in minutes.  Results The simulator trained group (n=11) reached a median total score of 33 points (interquartile range 32-36 points), equivalent to the experience gained after 20-50 laparoscopic procedures, whereas the control group (n=10) reached a median total score of 23 (22-27) points, equivalent to the experience gained from fewer than five procedures (P<0.001). The median total operation time in the simulator trained group was 12 minutes (interquartile range 10-14 minutes) and in the control group was 24 (20-29) minutes (P<0.001). The observers' inter-rater agreement was 0.79.  Conclusion Skills in laparoscopic surgery can be increased in a clinically relevant manner using proficiency based virtual reality simulator training. The performance level of novices was increased to that of intermediately experienced laparoscopists and operation time was halved. Simulator training should be considered before trainees carry out laparoscopic procedures.

METHOD: Sixteen children with cerebral palsy aged 8 to 12 years participated. They were observed during a variety of VR environments that were video recorded. The Pediatric Volitional Questionnaire (PVQ) was used to measure children's motivation. The PVQ provides insights into children's inner motives as well as how the virtual environment enhances or attenuates children's motives. Nine VR environments were randomly selected to score with the PVQ. RESULTS: Data were analyzed and descriptive statistics were calculated for modes and medians of total volition scores for each VR environment. Different environments produced varying levels of volitional behaviour. The features of environments that produced higher levels of volition included challenge, variability and competition. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The overall volitional scores of children with cerebral palsy in the current study indicate that VR play is a motivating activity and thus has potential as a successful intervention tool.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Virtual Reality (VR) technology offers promising opportunities to improve traditional treadmill-based rehabilitation programs. We present an immersive VR rehabilitation system that includes a head-mounted display and motion sensors. The application is designed to promote the experience of relatedness, autonomy, and competence. The application uses procedural content generation to generate diverse landscapes. We evaluated the effect of the immersive rehabilitation system on motivation and affect. We conducted a repeated measures study with 36 healthy participants to compare the immersive program to a traditional rehabilitation program. Participants reported significant greater enjoyment, felt more competent and experienced higher decision freedom and meaningfulness in the immersive VR gait training compared to the traditional training. They experienced significantly lower physical demand, simulator sickness, and state anxiety, and felt less pressured while still perceiving a higher personal performance. We derive three design implications for future applications in gait rehabilitation: Immersive VR provides a promising augmentation for gait rehabilitation. Gamification features provide a design guideline for content creation in gait rehabilitation. Relatedness and autonomy provide critical content features in gait rehabilitation.\",\n",

We discuss conceivable solutions and illustrate them by referring to relevant work by others and by means of AStar0ID, an exploratory prototype VR RTS science fiction game. Our main contribution is the systematic inspection and discussion of foundational RTS aspects in the context of VR and, thus, to provide a substantial basis to further rethink and evolve the RTS genre in this new light.\",\n",

Simulator development has focused on increasing authenticity and fidelity. Development has not necessarily been guided by evidence for educational improvement. On reviewing 34 years of literature, Issenberg et al identified ten features of high-fidelity medical simulators that facilitate learning. This study compares cadaveric temporal bone (CTB) simulation with the Voxel-Man TempoSurg (VT) virtual reality simulator in addressing these features.A questionnaire was designed comparing the VT with CTB. Fourteen trainees and six consultants completed the questionnaire after using the simulator.The VT is better at allowing repetitive practice, ease of control of difficulty, and capturing clinical and pathological variation. The VT is as good as CTB in curriculum integration, allowing multiple learning strategies, providing a controlled environment, individualising learning and defining benchmarks. It appears worse with regards to face validity and feedback.Virtual reality simulation and CTB have features that allow effective learning. Some of these are common to both, in some CTB is better and in others virtual reality is better. Virtual reality could be a significant mode of learning supplementary to CTB and experience in the operating theatre.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The design and evaluation of assisting technologies to support behavior change processes have become an essential topic within the field of human-computer interaction research in general and the field of immersive intervention technologies in particular. The mechanisms and success of behavior change techniques and interventions are broadly investigated in the field of psychology. However, it is not always easy to adapt these psychological findings to the context of immersive technologies. The lack of theoretical foundation also leads to a lack of explanation as to why and how immersive interventions support behavior change processes. The Behavioral Framework for immersive Technologies (BehaveFIT) addresses this lack by 1) presenting an intelligible categorization and condensation of psychological barriers and immersive features, by 2) suggesting a mapping that shows why and how immersive technologies can help to overcome barriers and finally by 3) proposing a generic prediction path that enables a structured, theory-based approach to the development and evaluation of immersive interventions. These three steps explain how BehaveFIT can be used, and include guiding questions for each step. Further, two use cases illustrate the usage of BehaveFIT. Thus, the present paper contributes to guidance for immersive intervention design and evaluation, showing that immersive interventions support behavior change processes and explain and predict 'why' and 'how' immersive interventions can bridge the intention-behavior-gap.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This article reviews the rationale, current status and future directions for the development and implementation of virtual reality surgical simulators as training tools.The complexity of modern surgical techniques, which utilize advanced technology, presents a dilemma for surgical training. Hands-on patient experience - the traditional apprenticeship method for teaching operations - may not apply because of the learning curve for skill acquisition and patient safety expectation. The paranasal sinuses and temporal bone have intricate anatomy with a significant amount of vital structures either within the surgical field or in close proximity. The current standard of surgical care in these areas involves the use of endoscopes, cameras and microscopes, requiring additional hand-eye coordination, an accurate command of fine motor skills, and a thorough knowledge of the anatomy under magnified vision. A surgeon's disorientation or loss of perspective can lead to complications, often catastrophic and occasionally lethal. These considerations define the ideal environment for surgical simulation; not surprisingly, significant research and validation of simulators in these areas have occurred.Virtual reality simulators are demonstrating validity as training and skills assessment tools. Future prototypes will find application for routine use in teaching, surgical planning and the development of new instruments and computer-assisted devices.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In this paper we propose omnidirectional galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to mitigate cybersickness in virtual reality applications. One of the most accepted theories indicates that Cybersickness is caused by the visually induced impression of ego motion while physically remaining at rest. As a result of this sensory mismatch, people associate negative symptoms with VR and sometimes avoid the technology altogether. To reconcile the two contradicting sensory perceptions, we investigate GVS to stimulate the vestibular canals behind our ears with low-current electrical signals that are specifically attuned to the visually displayed camera motion. We describe how to calibrate and generate the appropriate GVS signals in real-time for pre-recorded omnidirectional videos exhibiting ego-motion in all three spatial directions. For validation, we conduct an experiment presenting real-world 360\\u00b0 videos shot from a moving first-person perspective in a VR head-mounted display. Our findings indicate that GVS is able to significantly reduce discomfort for cybersickness-susceptible VR users, creating a deeper and more enjoyable immersive experience for many people.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In this paper, we propose a method to realize a virtual reality MMOG (Massively Multiplayer Online Video Game) with ultra-low latency. The basic idea of the proposed method is to introduce a layer consisting of several fog nodes between clients and cloud server to offload a part of the rendering task which is conducted by the cloud server in conventional cloud games. We examine three techniques to reduce the latency in such a fog-assisted cloud game: 1) To maintain the consistency of the virtual game space, collision detection of virtual objects is conducted by the cloud server in a centralized manner; 2) To reflect subtle changes of the line of sight to the 3D game view, each client is assigned to a fog node and the head motion of the player acquired through HMD (Head-Mounted Display) is directly sent to the corresponding fog node; and 3) To offload a part of the rendering task, we separate the rendering of the background view from that of the foreground view, and migrate the former to other nodes including the cloud server. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by experiments with an AWS-based prototype system. It is confirmed that the proposed techniques achieve the latency of 32.3 ms, which is 66 % faster than the conventional systems.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper presents the results of a pilot study of a virtual reality play based intervention. The results of four single case studies are presented. The virtual reality intervention used the Mandala Gesture Xtreme technology. It was applied to four school aged children with cerebral palsy. A pretest-posttest design was used. The relevant outcome of interest was upper extremity control as measured with the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST), item #6 of Subtest #5 of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP), and a measure of percent accuracy . The total scores on the QUEST indicated clinically significant changes in quality of upper extremity for two of the children. Changes were noted in other measures of upper extremity control for each child.Qualitative comments from the participants revealed a high degree of motivation, interest, pleasure, and opportunity for engagement in play activities not previously engaged in. Overall, this pilot study suggests the viability of a virtual reality play based intervention as part of the rehabilitation process for children with cerebral palsy. These results will form the basis of a larger scale randomized clinical trial.\",\n",

Therefore, recommendations relating to the optimal representation size of virtual information for an head mounted display with see through mode, which is used for Augmented Reality, cannot be given at the moment. In order to apply this new technology successfully to an industrial area, such information is urgently necessary. For this reason, three different kinds of displays were tested in this study regarding human information perception. Thus, the smallest target size necessary to provide successful information processing could be determined for different tasks.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Biometric measures such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) promise to become viable alternatives to subjective questionnaire ratings for the evaluation of psychophysical effects associated with Virtual Reality (VR) systems, as they provide objective and continuous measurements without breaking the exposure. The extent to which the EEG signal can be disturbed by the presence of VR sys- tems, however, has been barely investigated. This study outlines how to evaluate the compatibility of a given EEG-VR setup on the example of two commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs), the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro. We use a novel experimental protocol to compare the spectral composition between conditions with and without an HMD present during an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task. We found general artifacts at the line hum of 50 Hz, and additional HMD refresh rate artifacts (90 Hz) for the Oculus rift exclusively. Frequency components typically most interesting to non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz), however, remained largely unaffected. We observed similar topographies of visually-induced modulation of alpha band power for both HMD conditions in all subjects. Hence, the study introduces a necessary validation test for HMDs in combination with EEG and further promotes EEG as a potential biometric measurement method for psychophysical effects in VR systems.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Visual stimuli are frequently used to improve memory, language learning or perception, and understanding of metacognitive processes. However, in virtual reality (VR), there are few systematically and empirically derived databases. This paper proposes the first collection of virtual objects based on empirical evaluation for inter-and transcultural encounters between English- and German-speaking learners. We used explicit and implicit measurement methods to identify cultural associations and the degree of stereotypical perception for each virtual stimuli (n = 293) through two online studies, including native German and English-speaking participants. The analysis resulted in a final well-describable database of 128 objects (called InteractionSuitcase). In future applications, the objects can be used as a great interaction or conversation asset and behavioral measurement tool in social VR applications, especially in the field of foreign language education. For example, encounters can use the objects to describe their culture, or teachers can intuitively assess stereotyped attitudes of the encounters.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Many studies show the significance of the Proteus effect for serious virtual reality applications. The present study extends the existing knowledge by considering the relationship (congruence) between the self-embodiment (avatar) and the virtual environment. We investigated the impact of avatar and environment types and their congruence on avatar plausibility, sense of embodiment, spatial presence, and the Proteus effect. In a 2 \\u00d7 2 between-subjects design, participants embodied either an avatar in sports- or business wear in a semantic congruent or incongruent environment while performing lightweight exercises in virtual reality. The avatar-environment congruence significantly affected the avatar\\u2019s plausibility but not the sense of embodiment or spatial presence. However, a significant Proteus effect emerged only for participants who reported a high feeling of (virtual) body ownership, indicating that a strong sense of having and owning a virtual body is key to facilitating the Proteus effect. We discuss the results assuming current theories of bottom-up and top-down determinants of the Proteus effect and thus contribute to understanding its underlying mechanisms and determinants.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Currently, there is an ongoing debate about the influencing factors of one's extended reality (XR) experience. Plausibility, congruence, and their role have recently gained more and more attention. One of the latest models to describe XR experiences, the Congruence and Plausibility model (CaP), puts plausibility and congruence right in the center. However, it is unclear what influence they have on the overall XR experience and what influences our perceived plausibility rating. In this paper, we implemented four different incongruencies within a virtual reality scene using breaks in plausibility as an analogy to breaks in presence. These manipulations were either located on the cognitive or perceptual layer of the CaP model. They were also either connected to the task at hand or not. We tested these manipulations in a virtual bowling environment to see which influence they had. Our results show that manipulations connected to the task caused a lower perceived plausibility. Additionally, cognitive manipulations seem to have a larger influence than perceptual manipulations. We were able to cause a break in plausibility with one of our incongruencies. These results show a first direction on how the influence of plausibility in XR can be systematically investigated in the future.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In this paper we test the hypothesis that Virtual Reality (VR) negotiation training positively influences negotiation skill and knowledge. We discuss the design of the VR training. Then, we present the results of a between subject experiment (n=42) with three experimental conditions (control, training once, repeated training) investigating learning effects on subjects' negotiation skill and knowledge. In our case negotiation skill consists of negotiation outcome (final bid utility) and conversation skill (exploratory conversational choices in VR scenario), and negotiation knowledge is the subjects' quality of reflection upon filmed behavior of two negotiating actors. Our results confirm the hypothesis. We found significant effects of training on conversation skill and negotiation knowledge. We found a marginally significant effect of training on negotation outcome. As the effect of training on negotiation outcome was marginally significant and only present when controlling for overshadowing effects of the act of reflecting, we postulate that other learning approaches (e.g., instruction) are needed for trainees to use the information gained during the joint exploration phase of a negotiation for the construction of a bid. Our results are particularly important given the sparse availability of experimental studies that show learning effects of VR negotiation training, and gives additional support to those studies that do report possitive effects such as with the BiLAT system.\",\n",

The impairment of a person\\u2019s decision-making is a common goal of gambling games. Given the recent trend of gambling using immersive Virtual Reality it is crucial to investigate the effects of both immersion and the virtual environment (VE) on decision-making.

The versions differed with regard to the degree of immersion and design of the virtual environment.

We further found no significant difference between the conditions with regard to positive and negative affect. This suggests that neither the medium used nor the design of the VE causes an impairment of decision-making.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Presence is often considered the most important quale describing the subjective feeling of being in a computer-generated and/or computer-mediated virtual environment. The identification and separation of orthogonal presence components, i.e., the place illusion and the plausibility illusion, has been an accepted theoretical model describing Virtual Reality (VR) experiences for some time. This perspective article challenges this presence-oriented VR theory. First, we argue that a place illusion cannot be the major construct to describe the much wider scope of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR, AR, MR: or XR for short). Second, we argue that there is no plausibility illusion but merely plausibility, and we derive the place illusion caused by the congruent and plausible generation of spatial cues and similarly for all the current model\\u2019s so-defined illusions. Finally, we propose congruence and plausibility to become the central essential conditions in a novel theoretical model describing XR experiences and effects.\",\n",

Nowadays embedding advertisements, or incorporating text and graphics in TV scenes, are common practice, but they can not be considered as integrated part of the scene.

We analyse the main aspects related with the whole chain of augmented reality production.\\r\\n\\r\\nInteractivity is one of the most important added values of the digital television: This paper aims to break the model where all TV viewers receive the same final image. Thus, we introduce and discuss the new concept of interactive augmented television, i. e. real time composition of video and computer graphics - e.g. a real scene and freely selectable images or spatial rendered objects - edited and customized by the end user within the context of the user's set top box and TV receiver.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe demonstrate a sample application introducing \\\"Interactive Augmented Television\\\" for sport broadcasts additionally with 3D virtual objects in order to enhance or alter the presentation of the match with a new interface.

These spaces\\n                 arise from the solution of multi-objective optimisation\\n                 problems with more than 3 objective functions which\\n                 lead to high dimensional Pareto fronts. The 3-D\\n                 representations of m-dimensional Pareto fronts, or\\n                 their approximations, are constructed via similarity\\n                 structure mappings between the original objective\\n                 spaces and the 3-D space. Alpha shapes are introduced\\n                 for the representation and compared with previous\\n                 approaches based on convex hulls. In addition, the\\n                 mappings minimising a measure of the amount of\\n                 dissimilarity loss are obtained via genetic\\n                 programming. This approach is preliminarily\\n                 investigated using both theoretically derived high\\n                 dimensional Pareto fronts for a test problem (DTLZ2)\\n                 and practically obtained objective spaces for the 4\\n                 dimensional knapsack problem via multi-objective\\n                 evolutionary algorithms like HLGA, NSGA, and VEGA. The\\n                 improved representation captures more accurately the\\n                 real nature of the m-dimensional objective spaces and\\n                 the quality of the mappings obtained with genetic\\n                 programming is equivalent to those computed with\\n                 classical optimization algorithms.\",\n",

However, relatively little is known about the potential of this technology to support teaching and learning with groups of young children in the classroom. Analysis of teacher\\u2013child dialogue in a comparative study between use of an AR virtual mirror interface and more traditional science teaching methods for 10-year-old children, revealed that the children using AR were less engaged than those using traditional resources. We suggest four design requirements that need to be considered if AR is to be successfully adopted into classroom practice. These requirements are: flexible content that teachers can adapt to the needs of their children, guided exploration so learning opportunities can be maximised, in a limited time, and attention to the needs of institutional and curricular requirements.\",\n",

In order to run large simulations, we choose to put together a set of standard computers and create a grid in charge of distributing the biological simulations. We propose to make the distribution on to the ReISCOP generic model, developed in our laboratory, which allows us to easily design biological simulations. This method is also based on the replication of passive elements. It is a spatial distribution in which local simulations are periodically synchronized and the consistency of replicated data is checked. This synchronization is not a strong synchronization but a weak one. The consistency method is built on the transmission between nodes of the grid of the state variations of the data. The software used for distributing simulations is named DIVA, and is an individual based software located on each node of the grid. DIVA confers a peer to peer architecture upon the grid.\",\n",

      "    \"title\": \"Spatial Presence in Mixed Realities--Considerations about the Concept, Measures, Design, and Experiments\",\n",
      "    \"abstract\": \"Plenty of theories, models, measures, and investigations target the understanding of virtual presence, i.e., the sense of presence in immersive Virtual Reality (VR). Other varieties of the so-called eXtended Realities (XR), e.g., Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR and MR) incorporate immersive features to a lesser degree and continuously combine spatial cues from the real physical space and the simulated virtual space. This blurred separation questions the applicability of the accumulated knowledge about the similarities of virtual presence and presence occurring in other varieties of XR, and corresponding outcomes. The present work bridges this gap by analyzing the construct of presence in mixed realities (MR). To achieve this, the following presents (1) a short review of definitions, dimensions, and measurements of presence in VR, and (2) the state of the art views on MR. Additionally, we (3) derived a working definition of MR, extending the Milgram continuum. This definition is based on entities reaching from real to virtual manifestations at one time point. Entities possess different degrees of referential power, determining the selection of the frame of reference. Furthermore, we (4) identified three research desiderata, including research questions about the frame of reference, the corresponding dimension of transportation, and the dimension of realism in MR. Mainly the relationship between the main aspects of virtual presence of immersive VR, i.e., the place-illusion, and the plausibility-illusion, and of the referential power of MR entities are discussed regarding the concept, measures, and design of presence in MR. Finally, (5) we suggested an experimental setup to reveal the research heuristic behind experiments investigating presence in MR. The present work contributes to the theories and the meaning of and approaches to simulate and measure presence in MR. We hypothesize that research about essential underlying factors determining user experience (UX) in MR simulations and experiences is still in its infancy and hopes this article provides an encouraging starting point to tackle related questions.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In visual perception, change blindness describes the phenomenon that persons viewing a visual scene may apparently fail to detect significant changes in that scene. These phenomena have been observed in both computer generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic projection systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for passive and active stereoscopic viewing and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we find that change blindness phenomena can be applied with a larger magnitude as compared to monoscopic viewing of a scene. We have also evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Virtual reality (VR) has long promised to revolutionize education, but with\\nlittle follow-through. Part of the reason for this is the prohibitive cost of\\nimmersive VR headsets or caves. This has changed with the advent of\\nsmartphone-based VR (along the lines of Google cardboard) which allows students\\nto use smartphones and inexpensive plastic or cardboard viewers to enjoy\\nstereoscopic VR simulations. We have completed the largest-ever such study on\\n627 students enrolled in calculus-based freshman physics at The Ohio State\\nUniversity. This initial study focused on student understanding of electric\\nfields. Students were split into three treatments groups: VR, video, and static\\n2D images. Students were asked questions before, during, and after treatment.\\nHere we present a preliminary analysis including overall post-pre improvement\\namong the treatment groups, dependence of improvement on gender, and previous\\nvideo game experience. Results on select questions are discussed.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Humanoid robots (i.e., robots with a human-like body) are projected to be mass marketed in the future in several fields of\\r\\napplication. Today, however, user evaluations of humanoid robots are often based on mediated depictions rather than actual observations or interactions with a robot, which holds true not least for scientific user studies. People can be confronted with robots in various modes of presentation, among them (1) 2D videos, (2) 3D, i.e., stereoscopic videos, (3) immersive Virtual Reality (VR), or (4) live on site. A systematic investigation into how such differential modes of presentation influence user perceptions of a robot is still lacking. Thus, the current study systematically compares the effects of different presentation modes with varying immersive potential on user evaluations of a humanoid service robot. Participants (N = 120) observed an interaction between a humanoid service robot and an actor either on 2D or 3D video, via a virtual reality headset (VR) or live. We found support for the expected effect of the presentation mode on perceived immediacy. Effects regarding the degree of human likeness that was attributed to the robot were mixed. The presentation mode had no influence on evaluations in terms of eeriness, likability, and purchase intentions. Implications for empirical research on humanoid robots and practice are discussed.\",\n",

Pain management of children is not ideal, and some children unable to tolerate traditional pharmacological agents. Virtual reality (VR) is a new and promising form of non-pharmacologic analgesia. This case study explored the use of VR analgesia with a 16-year-old patient with cerebral palsy participating in a twice-daily physiotherapy program following Single Event Multi-Level Surgery. Over 6 days, the patient spent half of his physiotherapy sessions using VR and the other half without (order randomized). Traditional pharmacological pain management was administered throughout the trial. Using a subjective pain scale (five faces denoting levels of pain), the patient's overall pain ratings whilst in the VR (experimental) condition were 41.2\\\\% less than those in the no-VR (control) condition. This case report provides the first evidence that VR may serve as a powerful non-pharmacologic analgesic for children following surgery.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Navigation is considered one of the most fundamental challenges in Virtual Reality (VR) and has been extensively researched 11. The world-in-miniature (WIM) navigation metaphor allows users to travel in large-scale virtual environments (VEs) regardless of available physical space while maintaining a high-level overview of the VE. It relies on a hand-held, scaled-down duplicate of the entire VE, where the user\\u2019s current position is displayed, and an interface provided to introduce his/her next movements 17. There are several extensions to deal with challenges of this navigation technique, e.g. scaling and scrolling 23. In this work, a WIM is presented that integrates state-of-the-art research insights and incorporates additional features that became apparent during the integration process. These features are needed to improve user interactions and to provide both look-ahead and post-travel feedback. For instance, a novel occlusion handling feature hides the WIM geometry in a rounded space reaching from the user\\u2019s hand to his/her forearm. This allows the user to interact with occluded areas of the WIM such as buildings. Further extensions include different visualizations for occlusion handling, an interactive preview screen, post-travel feedback, automatic WIM customization, a unified diegetic UI design concerning WIM and user representation, and an adaptation of widely established gestures to control scaling and scrolling of the WIM. Overall, the presented WIM design integrates and extends state-of-the-art interaction tasks and visualization concepts to overcome open conceptual gaps and to provide a comprehensive practical solution for traveling in VR.\",\n",

We compared abstract avatar representations based on a wooden mannequin with high fidelity avatars generated from photogrammetry 3D scan methods. Both avatar representations were alternately applied to participating users and to the virtual counterpart in dyadic social encounters to examine the impact of avatar realism on self-embodiment and social interaction quality. Users were immersed in a virtual room via a head mounted display (HMD). Their full-body movements were tracked and mapped to respective movements of their avatars. Embodiment was induced by presenting the users\\u2019 avatars to themselves in a virtual mirror. Afterwards they had to react to a non-verbal behavior of a virtual interaction partner they encountered in the virtual space. Several measures were taken to analyze the effect of the appearance of the users\\u2019 avatars as well as the effect of the appearance of the others\\u2019 avatars on the users. The realistic avatars were rated significantly more human-like when used as avatars for the others and evoked a stronger acceptance in terms of virtual body ownership (VBO). There also was some indication of a potential uncanny valley. Additionally, there was an indication that the appearance of the others\\u2019 avatars impacts the self-perception of the users.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Active exploration enables us humans to construct a rich and coherent percept of our environment. By far the most natural way to move through the real world is via locomotion like walking or running. The same should also be true for computer generated three-dimensional environments. Keeping such an active and dynamic ability to navigate through large-scale virtual scenes is of great interest for many 3D applications demanding locomotion, such as tourism, architecture or interactive entertainment. However, today it is still mostly impossible to freely walk through computer generated environments in order to actively explore them. The primary reason for this is the scientific and technological underdevelopment in this sector. While moving in the real world, sensory information such as vestibular, proprioceptive, and efferent copy signals as well as visual information create consistent multi-sensory cues that indicate one's own motion, i.e., acceleration, speed and direction of travel. Computer graphics environments were initially restricted to visual displays, combined with interaction devices, e.g. joystick or mouse, for providing (often unnatural) inputs to generate self-motion. Nowadays, more and more interaction devices, e.g., Nintendo's Wii or Sony's EyeToy, enable intuitive and natural interaction. In this context, many research groups are investigating natural, multimodal methods of generating self-motion in virtual worlds based on these consumer hardware. An obvious approach is to transfer the user's tracked head movements to changes of the camera in the virtual world by means of a one-to-one mapping. Then, a one meter movement in the real world is mapped to a one meter movement of the virtual camera in the corresponding direction in the virtual environment (VE). This technique has the drawback that the user's movements are restricted by a limited range of the tracking sensors, e.g. optical cameras, and a rather small workspace in the real world. The size of the virtual world often differs from the size of the tracked space so that a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not possible. Thus, concepts for virtual locomotion methods are needed that enable walking over large distances in the virtual world while remaining within a relatively small space in the real world. In this tutorial we will present an overview about the development of locomotion interfaces for computer generated virtual environments ranging from desktop-based camera manipulations simulating walking, and different walking metaphors for virtual reality (VR)-based environments to state-of-the-art hardware-based solutions that enable omni-directional and unlimited real walking through virtual worlds.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"We present in this paper a new method for building and exploring a 3D hypermedia in virtual reality and for a biomedical domain. Starting from the acquisition of stereoscopic images and from the calibration of cameras, our system offers the user the possibility to visualize these images in 3D and to annotate specific areas with texts or voice recording. Then the user may define links between annotations, and each annotation may point to annotations from the same image or from other images. The user thus constructs a 3D hypermedia. He may have a global view of the images database using a graph display. We present a first graph which was built with images of faces.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Speed has become a way of life. We are asymptotically piling data. Speed can be achieved with new design processes, techniques, and Technology. Innovations AR and VR are just some of the many forms of technologies that will play a key role in shaping the Architecture and Planning of tomorrow, making it future-ready and ushering in a new age of innovation. AR and VR in Architecture & Planning were introduced as assisting tools and has helped generate multiple design options, expanded possibilities of visualization, and provided us with more enhanced, detailed, and specific experience in real-time; enabling us to see the resultsof work on hand well before the commencement of the project. These tools are further developed for city development decisions, helping citizens interact with local authorities, access public\\r\\nservices, and plan their commute. After reviewing multiple research papers, it had been observed that each one is moving forward with the changes brought by it, without entirely understanding its role. This paper provides a summary of theappliance of AR & VR in architecture and planning.\",\n",

We consider pose or viewpoint computation as a similar problem to visual servoing. It allows one to take advantage of all the research that has been carried out in\\r\\nthis domain in the past. The proposed method features simplicity, accuracy, efficiency, and scalability wrt. to the camera model as well as wrt. the features extracted from the image. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach on augmented reality applications with various real image sequences.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This article compares two state-of-the-art text input techniques between non-stationary virtual reality (VR) and video see-through augmented reality (VST AR) use-cases as XR display condition. The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and wordgesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"As the demand of Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming to mobile devices increases, novel optimization transport techniques need to be designed to cope with these ultra-high-bandwidth video services. One approach currently attracting attention is the application of adaptive tile-based streaming solutions to the VR video arena. The VR videos are encoded at different quality levels, temporally divided into segments and spatially split into tiles. During the streaming, each of these tiles can be transmitted independently according to its location within the frame (i.e., within or outside of the user's field of view). These methods open a new venue for bandwidth and latency optimization for the streaming of VR videos. However, the effect of the different adaptive streaming optimizations on the end-user perception is still an open research topic. In this demo, we present a VR video platform to experience the working principles of adaptive tile-based VR video streaming services. Through different tiling approaches, bandwidth conditions and viewport algorithms, it allows the users to explore the effects that each optimization has on the perception of the service. In addition, the platform provides real-time bandwidth savings and objective Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements to provide a quantitative analysis of the optimizations effects. This demo aims to provide a common playground for researchers to benchmark, and evaluate the performance of their optimization solutions.\",\n",

EFs are important cognitive functions for athletes. They are a relevant quality that distinguishes amateurs from professionals.\\r\\nMethod: The system is based on immersive technology, hence, the user interacts naturally and experiences a training session in a virtual world. The proposed system has a modular design supporting the extension of various so-called game modes. Game modes combine selected game mechanics with specific simulation content to target particular training aspects. The system architecture decouples selection/parameterization and analysis of training sessions via a coaching app from an Unity3D-based VR simulation core. Monitoring of user performance and progress is recorded by a database that sends the necessary feedback to the coaching app for analysis. Results: The system is tested for VR-critical performance criteria to reveal the usefulness of a new interaction paradigm in the cognitive training and analysis of EFs. Subjective ratings for overall usability show that the design as VR application enhances the user experience compared to a traditional desktop app; whereas the new, unfamiliar interaction paradigm does not negatively impact the effort for using the application.\\r\\nConclusion: The system can provide immersive training of EF in a fully virtual environment, eliminating potential distraction. It further provides an easy-to-use analyzes tool to compare user but also an automatic, adaptive training mode.\",\n",

OTSS supports self-made XR styluses based on consumer-grade six-degrees-of-freedom XR controllers and commercially available styluses.

The development compares three low-cost and low-tech options to equip controllers with a tip and includes a web browser-based surface providing support for interacting, handwriting, and sketching. The evaluation of the reference implementation based on the OTSS framework identified an average stylus precision of 0.98 mm (SD = 0.54 mm) and an average surface accuracy of 0.60 mm (SD = 0.32 mm) in a seated VR environment.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Affine transformations which are used in many engineering areas often escape an intuitive approach due to their high level of complexity and abstractness. Learners not only need to understand the basic rules of matrix algebra but are also challenged to understand how the theoretically grounded aspects result in object transformations. Therefore, we developed the Gamified Training Environment for Affine Transformation that directly encodes this abstract learning content in its game mechanics. By intuitively presenting and demanding the application of affine transformations in a virtual gamified training environment, learners train the application of the knowledge due to repetition while receiving immediate and highly immersive visual feedback about the outcomes of their inputs. Also, by providing a flow-inducing gameplay, users are highly motivated to practice their knowledge thus experiencing a higher learning quality. As the immersion, presence and spatial knowledge presentation can have a positive effect on the training outcome, GEtiT explores the effectivity of different visual immersion levels by providing a desktop and a VR version.

      "    \"abstract\": \"This article introduces the Off-The-Shelf Stylus (OTSS), a framework for 2D interaction (in 3D) as well as for handwriting and sketching with digital pen, ink, and paper on physically aligned virtual surfaces in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR: XR for short). OTSS supports self-made XR styluses based on consumer-grade six-degrees-of-freedom XR controllers and commercially available styluses. The framework provides separate modules for three basic but vital features: 1) The stylus module provides stylus construction and calibration features. 2) The surface module provides surface calibration and visual feedback features for virtual-physical 2D surface alignment using our so-called 3ViSuAl procedure, and surface interaction features. 3) The evaluation suite provides a comprehensive test bed combining technical measurements for precision, accuracy, and latency with extensive usability evaluations including handwriting and sketching tasks based on established visuomotor, graphomotor, and handwriting research. The framework\\u2019s development is accompanied by an extensive open source reference implementation targeting the Unity game engine using an Oculus Rift S headset and Oculus Touch controllers. The development compares three low-cost and low-tech options to equip controllers with a tip and includes a web browser-based surface providing support for interacting, handwriting, and sketching. The evaluation of the reference implementation based on the OTSS framework identified an average stylus precision of 0.98 mm (SD = 0.54 mm) and an average surface accuracy of 0.60 mm (SD = 0.32 mm) in a seated VR environment. The time for displaying the stylus movement as digital ink on the web browser surface in VR was 79.40 ms on average (SD = 23.26 ms), including the physical controller\\u2019s motion-to-photon latency visualized by its virtual representation (M = 42.57 ms, SD = 15.70 ms). The usability evaluation (N = 10) revealed a low task load, high usability, and high user experience. Participants successfully reproduced given shapes and created legible handwriting, indicating that the OTSS and it\\u2019s reference implementation is ready for everyday use. We provide source code access to our implementation, including stylus and surface calibration and surface interaction features, making it easy to reuse, extend, adapt and/or replicate previous results (https://go.uniwue.de/hci-otss).\",\n",

This case report investigated the effects of VR therapy on cortical reorganization and associated motor function in an 8-year-old male with hemiparetic CP. Cortical activation and associated motor development were measured before and after VR therapy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and standardized motor tests. Before VR therapy, the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices (SMCs) and ipsilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) were predominantly activated during affected elbow movement. After VR therapy, the altered activations disappeared and the contralateral SMC was activated. This neuroplastic change was associated with enhanced functional motor skills including reaching, self-feeding, and dressing. These functions were not possible before the intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study in the literature that provides evidence for neuroplasticity after VR therapy in a child with hemiparetic CP.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Adding virtual objects to real environments plays an important role in todays computer graphics: Typical examples are virtual furniture in a real room and virtual characters in real movies. For a believable appearance, consistent lighting of the virtual objects is required. We present an augmented reality system that displays virtual objects with consistent illumination and shadows in the image of a simple webcam. We use two high dynamic range video cameras with fisheye lenses permanently recording the environment illumination. A sampling algorithm selects a few bright parts in one of the wide angle images and the corresponding points in the second camera image. The 3D position can then be calculated using epipolar geometry. Finally, the selected point lights are used in a multipass algorithm to draw the virtual object with shadows. To validate our approach, we compare the appearance and shadows of the synthetic objects with real objects.\",\n",

It is based on VRML/X3D to enable rendering of audio-visual information. We extended our VRML rendering system by a device management system that is based on the concept of a data-flow graph. The aim of the system is to create Mixed Reality (MR) applications simply by plugging together small prefabricated software components, instead of compiling monolithic C++ applications. The flexibility and the advantages of the presented framework are explained on the basis of an exemplary implementation of a classic Augmented Realityapplication and its extension to a collaborative remote expert scenario.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The impact of gender and hand dominance on operative performance may be a subject of prejudice among surgeons, reportedly leading to discrimination and lack of professional promotion. However, very little objective evidence is available yet on the matter. This study was conducted to identify factors that influence surgeons' performance, as measured by a virtual reality computer simulator for laparoscopic surgery.This study included 25 surgical residents who had limited experience with laparoscopic surgery, having performed fewer than 10 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The participants were registered according to their gender, hand dominance, and experience with computer games. All of the participants performed 10 repetitions of the six tasks on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) within 1 month. Assessment of laparoscopic skills was based on three parameters measured by the simulator: time, errors, and economy of hand movement.Differences in performance existed between the compared groups. Men completed the tasks in less time than women ( p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test), but there was no statistical difference between the genders in the number of errors and unnecessary movements. Individuals with right hand dominance performed fewer unnecessary movements ( p = 0.045, Mann-Whitney test), and there was a trend toward better results in terms of time and errors among the residence with right hand dominance than among those with left dominance. Users of computer games made fewer errors than nonusers ( p = 0.035, Mann-Whitney test).The study provides objective evidence of a difference in laparoscopic skills between surgeons differing gender, hand dominance, and computer experience. These results may influence the future development of training program for laparoscopic surgery. They also pose a challenge to individuals responsible for the selection and training of the residents.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"OBJECTIVES: Validation of a virtual reality (VR) simulator for the training and assessment of laparoscopic tubal surgery and mapping of cognitive load. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted at the Imperial College Virtual Reality Surgical Skills laboratory amongst 25 trainees and nine senior gynaecologists. Participants performed two sessions of salpingectomy and salpingotomy procedures on a VR simulator to assess construct validity. Nine novices performed ten such sessions to enable assessment of the learning curve. The relationship between cognitive load and the dexterity parameters was assessed. Simulator fidelity was reported by experienced and intermediate level gynaecologists. Statistical analyses utilised non-parametric tests, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Learning curves were assessed using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Relationship between dexterity metrics and cognitive load was performed using Spearman's rank order correlation. RESULTS: Salpingectomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken by experienced, intermediate and novice gynaecologists (median 170 vs. 191 vs. 313s (P=0.003) respectively) and movements (median 200 vs. 267 vs. 376s, P=0.045). Salpingotomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken (median 183 vs. 191 vs. 306s, P=<0.001) and movements (median 210 vs. 233 vs. 328s, P=0.005). Learning curve analysis for salpingectomy displayed a plateau for time taken after the eighth session, and the fourth session for movements. Salpingotomy displayed a plateau after the eighth session for both time taken and movements. Cognitive load correlated significantly with dexterity parameters. The fidelity scores were not significantly different between the two procedures (P=0.619). CONCLUSION: The LAP Mentor VR laparoscopic simulator is a valid and effective tool for training novice surgeons in ectopic pregnancy surgery. Reduction in cognitive load significantly correlates with the learning curves.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Motion tracking \\\"telemetry\\\" data lies at the core of nearly all modern virtual reality (VR) and metaverse experiences. While generally presumed innocuous, recent studies have demonstrated that motion data actually has the potential to uniquely identify VR users. In this study, we go a step further, showing that a variety of private user information can be inferred just by analyzing motion data recorded from VR devices. We conducted a large-scale survey of VR users (N=1,006) with dozens of questions ranging from background and demographics to behavioral patterns and health information. We then obtained VR motion samples of each user playing the game \\\"Beat Saber,\\\" and attempted to infer their survey responses using just their head and hand motion patterns. Using simple machine learning models, over 40 personal attributes could be accurately and consistently inferred from VR motion data alone. Despite this significant observed leakage, there remains limited awareness of the privacy implications of VR motion data, highlighting the pressing need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in multi-user VR applications.\",\n",

The aim of this paper is to model the bone sawing process in order to develop a valid training simulator for the bilateral sagittal split osteotomy, the most often applied corrective surgery in case of a malposition of the mandible. Bone samples from a human cadaveric mandible were tested using a designed experimental system. Image processing and statistical analysis were used for the selection of four models for the bone sawing process.

Children with spastic CP completed ankle selective motor control exercises using a virtual reality (VR) exercise system and conventional (Conv) exercises. Ankle movements were recorded with an electrogoniometer. Children and their parents were asked to comment on their interest in the exercise programs. Greater fun and enjoyment were expressed during the VR exercises. Children completed more repetitions of the Conv exercises, but the range of motion and hold time in the stretched position were greater during VR exercises. These data suggest that using VR to elicit or guide exercise may improve exercise compliance and enhance exercise effectiveness.\",\n",

We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systems\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics.\\r\\nIn previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This work\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 mshop provides a face\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090to\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems RIS. Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as real\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepa\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current state\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090of\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090the\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sum\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 omarize the work our community is doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nArranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop's goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Systems. Six development systems are presented InTml, Lightning, FlowVR, OpenMASK VISTA, and MORGAN \\r\\n* Abstraction Is \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 sues. Two papers address the issues of reusable VE platforms and alterna tives to scene graphs. \\r\\n* Special Issues. In this section we collect papers related to the implementation of RIS in particular platforms, such as mobile systems, multi\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090rate systems, and Mixed Reality. \\r\\n* Semantic and Dynamic Modeling. The four papers in this section show models for expli\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0090 citly describing semantic (i.e. \\u00e4 chair is on the floor\\\") and dynamic information.\\r\\n* Semantic and Dynamic Modeling.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Slot machines are one of the most played games by players suffering from gambling disorder. New technologies like immersive Virtual Reality (VR) offer more possibilities to exploit erroneous beliefs in the context of gambling. Recent research indicates a higher risk potential when playing a slot machine in VR than on desktop. To continue this investigation, we evaluate the effects of providing different degrees of embodiment, i.e., minimal and full embodiment. The avatars used for the full embodiment further differ in their appearance, i.e., they elicit a high or a low socio-economic status. The virtual environment (VE) design can cause a potential influence on the overall gambling behavior. Thus, we also embed the slot machine in two different VEs that differ in their emotional design: a colorful underwater playground environment and a virtual counterpart of our lab. These design considerations resulted in four different versions of the same VR slot machine: 1) full embodiment with high socio-economic status, 2) full embodiment with low socio-economic status, 3) minimal embodiment playground VE, and 4) minimal embodiment laboratory VE. Both full embodiment versions also used the playground VE. We determine the risk potential by logging gambling frequency as well as stake size, and measuring harm-inducing factors, i.e., dissociation, urge to gamble, dark flow, and illusion of control, using questionnaires. Following a between groups experimental design, 82 participants played for 20 game rounds one of the four versions. We recruited our sample from the students enrolled at the University of W\\u00fcrzburg. Our safety protocol ensured that only participants without any recent gambling activity took part in the experiment. In this comparative user study, we found no effect of the embodiment nor VE design on neither the gambling frequency, stake sizes, nor risk potential. However, our results provide further support for the hypothesis of the higher visual angle on gambling stimuli and hence the increased emotional response being the true cause for the higher risk potential.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Multimodal Interfaces (MMIs) have been considered to provide promising interaction paradigms for Virtual Reality (VR) for some time. However, they are still far less common than unimodal interfaces (UMIs). This paper presents a summative user study comparing an MMI to a typical UMI for a design task in VR. We developed an application targeting creative 3D object manipulations, i.e., creating 3D objects and modifying typical object properties such as color or size. The associated open user task is based on the Torrence Tests of Creative Thinking. We compared a synergistic multimodal interface using speech-accompanied pointing/grabbing gestures with a more typical unimodal interface using a hierarchical radial menu to trigger actions on selected objects. Independent judges rated the creativity of the resulting products using the Consensual Assessment Technique. Additionally, we measured the creativity-promoting factors flow, usability, and presence. Our results show that the MMI performs on par with the UMI in all measurements despite its limited flexibility and reliability. These promising results demonstrate the technological maturity of MMIs and their potential to extend traditional interaction techniques in VR efficiently.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Psycho-pathological conditions, such as depression or schizophrenia, are often accompanied by a distorted perception of time. People suffering from this conditions often report that the passage of time slows down considerably and that they are ``stuck in time.'' Virtual Reality (VR) could potentially help to diagnose and maybe treat such mental conditions. However, the conditions in which a VR simulation could correctly diagnose a time perception deviation are still unknown. In this paper, we present an experiment investigating the difference in time experience with and without a virtual body in VR, also known as avatar. The process of substituting a person's body with a virtual body is called avatar embodiment. Numerous studies demonstrated interesting perceptual, emotional, behavioral, and psychological effects caused by avatar embodiment. However, the relations between time perception and avatar embodiment are still unclear. Whether or not the presence or absence of an avatar is already influencing time perception is still open to question. Therefore, we conducted a between-subjects design with and without avatar embodiment as well as a real condition (avatar vs. no-avatar vs. real). A group of 105 healthy subjects had to wait for seven and a half minutes in a room without any distractors (e.g., no window, magazine, people, decoration) or time indicators (e.g., clocks, sunlight). The virtual environment replicates the real physical environment. Participants were unaware that they will be asked to estimate their waiting time duration as well as describing their experience of the passage of time at a later stage. Our main finding shows that the presence of an avatar is leading to a significantly faster perceived passage of time. It seems to be promising to integrate avatar embodiment in future VR time-based therapy applications as they potentially could modulate a user's perception of the passage of time. We also found no significant difference in time perception between the real and the VR conditions (avatar, no-avatar), but further research is needed to better understand this outcome.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) is a well-established apparatus to measure anxiety in rodents, i.e., animals exhibiting an increased relative time spent in the closed vs. the open arms are considered anxious. To examine whether such anxiety-modulated behaviors are conserved in humans, we re-translated this paradigm to a human setting using virtual reality in a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) system. In two studies, we examined whether the EPM exploration behavior of humans is modulated by their trait anxiety and also assessed the individuals' levels of acrophobia (fear of height), claustrophobia (fear of confined spaces), sensation seeking, and the reported anxiety when on the maze. First, we constructed an exact virtual copy of the animal EPM adjusted to human proportions. In analogy to animal EPM studies, participants (N = 30) freely explored the EPM for 5 min. In the second study (N = 61), we redesigned the EPM to make it more human-adapted and to differentiate influences of trait anxiety and acrophobia by introducing various floor textures and lower walls of closed arms to the height of standard handrails. In the first experiment, hierarchical regression analyses of exploration behavior revealed the expected association between open arm avoidance and Trait Anxiety, an even stronger association with acrophobic fear. In the second study, results revealed that acrophobia was associated with avoidance of open arms with mesh-floor texture, whereas for trait anxiety, claustrophobia, and sensation seeking, no effect was detected. Also, subjects' fear rating was moderated by all psychometrics but trait anxiety. In sum, both studies consistently indicate that humans show no general open arm avoidance analogous to rodents and that human EPM behavior is modulated strongest by acrophobic fear, whereas trait anxiety plays a subordinate role. Thus, we conclude that the criteria for cross-species validity are met insufficiently in this case. Despite the exploratory nature, our studies provide in-depth insights into human exploration behavior on the virtual EPM.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Mindfulness is considered an important factor of an individual's subjective well-being. Consequently, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has investigated approaches that strengthen mindfulness, i.e., by inventing multimedia technologies to support mindfulness meditation. These approaches often use smartphones, tablets, or consumer-grade desktop systems to allow everyday usage in users' private lives or in the scope of organized therapies. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR; in short: XR) significantly extend the design space for such approaches. XR covers a wide range of potential sensory stimulation, perceptive and cognitive manipulations, content presentation, interaction, and agency. These facilities are linked to typical XR-specific perceptions that are conceptually closely related to mindfulness research, such as (virtual) presence and (virtual) embodiment. However, a successful exploitation of XR that strengthens mindfulness requires a systematic analysis of the potential interrelation and influencing mechanisms between XR technology, its properties, factors, and phenomena and existing models and theories of the construct of mindfulness. This article reports such a systematic analysis of XR-related research from HCI and life sciences to determine the extent to which existing research frameworks on HCI and mindfulness can be applied to XR technologies, the potential of XR technologies to support mindfulness, and open research gaps. Fifty papers of ACM Digital Library and National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (PubMed) with and without empirical efficacy evaluation were included in our analysis. The results reveal that at the current time, empirical research on XR-based mindfulness support mainly focuses on therapy and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, most of the currently investigated XR-supported mindfulness interactions are limited to vocally guided meditations within nature-inspired virtual environments. While an analysis of empirical research on those systems did not reveal differences in mindfulness compared to non-mediated mindfulness practices, various design proposals illustrate that XR has the potential to provide interactive and body-based innovations for mindfulness practice. We propose a structured approach for future work to specify and further explore the potential of XR as mindfulness-support. The resulting framework provides design guidelines for XR-based mindfulness support based on the elements and psychological mechanisms of XR interactions.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This article presents a platform for software technology research in the area of intelligent Realtime Interactive Systems. Simulator X is targeted at Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and computer games. It provides a foundation and testbed for a variety of different application models. The current research architecture is based on the actor model to support fine grained concurrency and parallelism. Its design follows the minimize coupling and maximize cohesion software engineering principle. A distributed world state and execution scheme is combined with an object-centered world view based on an entity model. Entities conceptually aggregate properties internally represented by state variables. An asynchronous event mechanism allows intra- and interprocess communication between the simulation actors. An extensible world interface uses an ontology-based semantic annotation layer to provide a coherent world view of the resulting distributed world state and execution scheme to application developers. The world interface greatly simplifies configurability and the semantic layer provides a solid foundation for the integration of different Artificial Intelligence components. The current architecture is implemented in Scala using the Java virtual machine. This choice additionally fosters low-level scalability, portability, and reusability.\",\n",

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are well suited as a complex test-bed for evaluation of user interfaces based on multi-modal input. Recent developments in the area of interactive surfaces enable the construction of low-cost multi-touch sensors and relatively inexpensive technology for detecting foot gestures allows exploring these input modalities for virtual reality environments. In this paper, we describe an intuitive 3D user interface setup, which combines multi-touch hand and foot gestures for interaction with spatial data.\",\n",

Consequently, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has investigated approaches that strengthen mindfulness, i.e., by inventing multimedia technologies to support mindfulness meditation. These approaches often use smartphones, tablets, or consumer-grade desktop systems to allow everyday usage in users' private lives or in the scope of organized therapies. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR; in short: XR) significantly extend the design space for such approaches. XR covers a wide range of potential sensory stimulation, perceptive and cognitive manipulations, content presentation, interaction, and agency. These facilities are linked to typical XR-specific perceptions that are conceptually closely related to mindfulness research, such as (virtual) presence and (virtual) embodiment. However, a successful exploitation of XR that strengthens mindfulness requires a systematic analysis of the potential interrelation and influencing mechanisms between XR technology, its properties, factors, and phenomena and existing models and theories of the construct of mindfulness. This article reports such a systematic analysis of XR-related research from HCI and life sciences to determine the extent to which existing research frameworks on HCI and mindfulness can be applied to XR technologies, the potential of XR technologies to support mindfulness, and open research gaps. Fifty papers of ACM Digital Library and National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (PubMed) with and without empirical efficacy evaluation were included in our analysis. The results reveal that at the current time, empirical research on XR-based mindfulness support mainly focuses on therapy and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, most of the currently investigated XR-supported mindfulness interactions are limited to vocally guided meditations within nature-inspired virtual environments. While an analysis of empirical research on those systems did not reveal differences in mindfulness compared to non-mediated mindfulness practices, various design proposals illustrate that XR has the potential to provide interactive and body-based innovations for mindfulness practice. We propose a structured approach for future work to specify and further explore the potential of XR as mindfulness-support. The resulting framework provides design guidelines for XR-based mindfulness support based on the elements and psychological mechanisms of XR interactions.\",\n",

We have developed a number of spatial interaction techniques that optically capture the device\\u2032s movement and orientation relative to a visual marker. Such physical interactions in 3D space enable manipulative control of mobile games. In addition to acting as a physical controller that recognizes multiple game-dependent gestures, the mobile device augments the camera view with graphical overlays. We describe three game prototypes that use ubiquitous product packaging and other passive media as backgrounds for handheld augmentation. The prototypes can be realized on widely available off-the-shelf hardware and require only minimal setup and infrastructure support.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Background. The rehabilitation of gait disorders in multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke patients is often based on conventional treadmill training. Virtual reality (VR)-based treadmill training can increase motivation and improve therapy outcomes.\\r\\nObjective. The present study aimed at (1) demonstrating the feasibility and acceptance of an immersive virtual reality application (presented via head-mounted display, HMD) for gait rehabilitation with patients, and (2) compare its effects to a semi-immersive presentation (via a monitor) and a conventional treadmill training without VR. \\r\\nMethods and results.  36 healthy participants and 14 persons with MS or stroke participated in each of the three experimental conditions. For both groups, the walking speed in the HMD condition was higher than in treadmill training without VR. Healthy participants reported a higher motivation after the HMD condition as compared with the other conditions. Importantly, no side effects in the sense of simulator sickness occurred and usability ratings were high. Most of the healthy study participants (89 %) and patients (71 %) preferred the HMD-based training among the three conditions and most patients could imagine using it more frequently.\\r\\nConclusion. The study demonstrated the feasibility of combining a treadmill training with immersive VR. Due to its high usability and low side effects, the immersive system could serve as a valid alternative to conventional treadmill training in gait rehabilitation. It might be particularly suited for patients to improve training motivation and training outcome e. g. the walking speed compared with treadmill training using no or only semi-immersive VR.\",\n",

      "    \"title\": \"A Structured Approach to Test the Signal Quality of Electroencephalography Measurements During Use of Head-Mounted Displays for Virtual Reality Applications\",\n",
      "    \"abstract\": \"Joint applications of virtual reality (VR) systems and electroencephalography (EEG) offer numerous new possibilities ranging from behavioral science to therapy. VR systems allow for highly controlled experimental environments, while EEG offers a non-invasive window to brain activity with a millisecond-ranged temporal resolution. However, EEG measurements are highly susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in healthy subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artifacts, especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of 90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected. Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings, at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary devices.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multi-focal progressive disorder of the central nervous system often resulting in diverse clinical manifestations. Imbalance appears in most people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). A popular balance training tool is virtual reality (VR) with several advantages including increased compliance and user satisfaction. Therefore, the aim of this pilot RCT (Trial registration number, date: ISRCTN14425615, 21/01/2016) was to examine the efficacy of a 6-week VR balance training program using the computer assisted rehabilitation environment (CAREN) system (Motek Medical BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands) on balance measures in PwMS. Results were compared with those of a conventional balance exercise group. Secondary aims included the impact of this program on the fear of falling.\",\n",

In essence, we are searching for a 3-D user interface metaphor as powerful as the desktop metaphor for 2-D. At the heart of the Studierstube system, collaborative augmented reality is used to embed computer-generated images into the real work environment In the #rst part of this paper, we review the user interface of the initial Studierstube system, in particular the implementation of collaborative augmented reality , and the Personal Interaction Panel, a two-handed interface for interaction with the system. In the second part, an extended Studierstube system based on a heterogeneous distributed architecture is presented. This system allows the user to combine multiple approaches--- augmented reality, projection displays, and ubiquitous computing---to the interface as needed. The environment is controlled by the Personal Interaction Panel, a twohanded, pen-and-pad interface that has versatile uses for interacting with the virtual environment. Studierstube also borrows elements from the desktop, such as multitasking and multi-windowing. The resulting software architecture is a user interface management system for complex augmented reality applications. The presentation is complemented by selected application examples 1\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper introduces a novel graphics rendering pipeline applied to augmented reality, based on a real time ray tracing paradigm. Ray tracing techniques process pixels independently from each other, allowing an easy integration with image-based tracking techniques, contrary to traditional projection-based rasterization graphics systems, e.g. OpenGL. Therefore, by associating our highly optimized ray tracer with an augmented reality framework, the proposed pipeline is capable to provide high quality rendering with real time interaction between virtual and real objects, such as occlusions, soft shadows, custom shaders, reflections and self-reflections, some of these features only available in our rendering pipeline. As proof of concept, we present a case study with the ARToolKitPlus library and the Microsoft Kinect hardware, both integrated in our pipeline. Furthermore, we show the performance and visual results in high definition of the novel pipeline on modern graphics cards, presenting occlusion and recursive reflection effects between virtual and real objects without the latter ones needing to be previously modeled when using Kinect. Furthermore, an adaptive soft shadow sampling algorithm for ray tracing is presented, generating high quality shadows in real time for most scenes.\",\n",

It is the way to encountering, feeling and contacting the past, present and whats to come. It is the medium of making our very own reality, our own customized reality. It could go from making a computer game to having a virtual walk around the universe, from strolling through our very own fantasy house to encountering a stroll on an outsider planet. With computer generated reality, we can encounter the scariest and exhausting circumstances by playing safe and with a learning point of view. Not many individuals, be that as it may, truly realize what VR is, the thing that it is fundamental standards and its open issues are. In this paper a chronicled outline of computer generated reality is displayed, essential wording and classes of VR frameworks are recorded. A savvy investigation of normal VR frameworks is done and finds the difficulties of Virtual Reality. Augmented reality, in which virtual substance is reliably planned with grandstands of genuine scenes, is a creating zone of natural arrangement. With the climb of individual cellphones prepared for making charming augmented reality conditions, the tremendous ability of AR has begun to be examined. This paper audits the present forefront in expanded reality. It delineates work performed in different application territories and clears up the leaving issues experienced when building extended reality applications considering the ergonomic besides, specialized confinements of cell phones.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Ubiquitous augmented reality is an emerging human-computer interaction technology, aris- ing from the convergence of augmented reality and ubiquitous computing. Augmented reality allows interaction with virtual objects spatially registered in the user\\u2019s real environment, in order to provide information, facilitate collaboration and control machines. As the comput- ing and interaction devices necessary for augmented reality become ubiquitously available, opportunities arise for improved interaction and new applications.\\r\\nBuilding ubiquitous augmented reality systems presents three software engineering chal- lenges. First, the system must cope with uncertainty regarding the software components; the users\\u2019 mobility changes the availability of distributed devices. Second, during development, the system\\u2019s desired behavior is ill-defined, as appropriate interaction metaphors are still be- ing researched and users\\u2019 preferences change. Third, the system must maintain near-real-time performance to create a convincing user experience.\\r\\nThis dissertation presents a new architectural style, the adaptive service dependency architec- ture, to address these challenges.\\r\\nThe architecture deals with component uncertainty, using middleware for decentralized ser- vice management to dynamically adapt the system\\u2019s structure. It builds on existing architec- tural approaches, such as loosely coupled services, service discovery, reflection, and data flow architectures, but additionally considers the interdependencies between distributed services and uses them for system adaption.\\r\\nWith the development technique of design at run time, users and developers address ill- defined requirements by changing the system\\u2019s behavior while it is running, facilitating the creation of new applications. This is based on existing agile development methods, but takes additional advantage of the architecture\\u2019s adaptive and reflective properties.\\r\\nDistributed middleware maintains the required performance by decoupling multimedia data flow from system reconfiguration. It combines existing communication and service discovery technologies, but additionally deals with the distributed coordination of networks of interde- pendent services.\\r\\nSeveral prototype systems for real-world ubiquitous augmented reality applications have been built using the adaptive service dependency architecture, decentralized middleware, and design at run time. Feedback from users and developers, as well as performance tests, show the concepts\\u2019 usefulness for building ubiquitous augmented reality systems.\",\n",

Augmented reality (AR) neuronavigation is a significant advance, providing a real-time updated 3D virtual model of anatomical details, overlaid on the real surgical field. Currently, only a few AR systems have been tested in a clinical setting. The aim is to review such devices. We performed a PubMed search of reports restricted to human studies of in vivo applications of AR in any neurosurgical procedure using the search terms ``Augmented reality'' and ``Neurosurgery.'' Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers in an unblinded standardized manner. The systems were qualitatively evaluated on the basis of the following: neurosurgical subspecialty of application, pathology of treated lesions and lesion locations, real data source, virtual data source, tracking modality, registration technique, visualization processing, display type, and perception location. Eighteen studies were included during the period 1996 to September 30, 2015. The AR systems were grouped by the real data source: microscope (8), hand- or head-held cameras (4), direct patient view (2), endoscope (1), and X-ray fluoroscopy (1) head-mounted display (1). A total of 195 lesions were treated: 75 (38.46\\u00a0\\\\%) were neoplastic, 77 (39.48\\u00a0\\\\%) neurovascular, and 1 (0.51\\u00a0\\\\%) hydrocephalus, and 42 (21.53\\u00a0\\\\%) were undetermined. Current literature confirms that AR is a reliable and versatile tool when performing minimally invasive approaches in a wide range of neurosurgical diseases, although prospective randomized studies are not yet available and technical improvements are needed.\",\n",

While it may appear that a natural approach is to develop application-specific data formats and management strategies, we have found that such an approach actually prevents reuse of the data and ultimately produces additional complexity in developing the application. In contrast we describe a three-tier architecture to manage a common data model for a set of applications. It is inspired by current Internet application frameworks and consists of a central storage layer using a common data model, a transformation layer responsible for filtering and adapting the data to the requirements of a particular applications on request, and finally of the applications itself. We demonstrate our architecture in a scenario consisting of two multi-user capable mobile AR applications for collaborative navigation and annotation in a city environment.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"A useful function of augmented reality (AR) systems is their ability to visualize occluded infrastructure directly in a user\\u2019s view of the environment. This is especially important for our application context, which utilizes mobile AR for navigation and other operations in an urban environment. A key problem in the AR field is how to best depict occluded objects in such a way that the viewer can correctly infer the depth relationships between different physical and virtual objects. Showing a single occluded object with no depth context presents an ambiguous picture to the user. But showing all occluded objects in the environments leads to the \\u201cSuperman\\u2019s X-ray vision \\u201d problem, in which the user sees too much information to make sense of the depth relationships of objects. Our efforts differ qualitatively from previous work in AR occlusion, because our application domain involves farfield occluded objects, which are tens of meters distant from the user. Previous work has focused on near-field occluded objects, which are within or just beyond arm\\u2019s reach, and which use different perceptual cues. We designed and evaluated a number of sets of display attributes. We then conducted a user study to determine which representations best express occlusion relationships among far-field objects. We identify a drawing style and opacity settings that enable the user to accurately interpret three layers of occluded objects, even in the absence of perspective constraints. 1\",\n",

Charakteristisch f\\u00fcr Augmented Reality (AR) ist die Anreicherung des Sichtfeldes des Betrachters mit rechnergenerierten virtuellen Objekten, um damit Produkt oder Prozessinformationen situationsgerecht im Kontext zur wahrgenommenen Realit\\u00e4t intuitiv nutzbar zu machen. Diese innovative Art der Mensch-Technik-Interaktion erfordert neben der anwendungsorientierten Entwicklung der AR-Basistechnologien insbesondere die Ber\\u00fccksichtigung von Benutzeranforderungen bei der ergonomischen Gestaltung von AR-Systemen. Die Projektideen wurden in f\\u00fcr die deutsche Industrie relevanten Anwendungsfeldern wie Automobil- und Flugzeugbau, Maschinen- und Anlagenbau realisiert. Eine besondere Perspektive war damit f\\u00fcr mittelst\\u00e4ndische Unternehmen verbunden, die durch verbesserte Diagnose- und Wartungskompetenz flexibler und effizienter agieren k\\u00f6nnen und damit eine St\\u00e4rkung im globalen Wettbewerb erfahren. Konkret erfolgte im Rahmen von ARVIKA die Konzentration bei der Entwicklung auf das Automobil, bei der Produktion auf das Automobil und Flugzeug und beim Service auf die Kraftwerksanlagentechnik sowie Werkzeug- und Produktionsmaschinen. Dadurch wurden wesentliche industrielle Einsatzf\\u00e4lle von AR abgedeckt und die notwendige anwendungsorientierte Tiefe zur Verifikation dieser neuartigen Technik erreicht. Diese inhaltlichen Schwerpunkte waren in einen Prozess der benutzerzentrierten Systemgestaltung eingebettet, die das Projekt in allen Phasen begleitet und sich auf arbeitswissenschaftliche Methoden st\\u00fctzt. Durch die Einbeziehung potentieller zuk\\u00fcnftiger Benutzer wurde sichergestellt, dass die entwickelten AR-Systeme den Anforderungen von Mitarbeitern, Arbeitsprozessen und M\\u00e4rkten entsprechen, die Benutzungsschnittstellen ergonomisch gestaltet wurden und Verbesserungen der Arbeitsorganisation bei den Projektpartnern durch AR-Funktionalit\\u00e4ten in den prototypischen Umsetzungen nachgewiesen werden konnten und somit auch ein Beleg der wirtschaftlichen Effekte stattfand.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Color blindness is a highly prevalent vision impairment that inhibits people's ability to understand colors. Although classified as a mild disability, color blindness has important effects on the daily activity of people, preventing them from performing their tasks in the most natural and effective ways. In order to address this issue we developed Chroma, a wearable augmented-reality system based on Google Glass that allows users to see a filtered image of the current scene in real-time. Chroma automatically adapts the scene-view based on the type of color blindness, and features dedicated algorithms for color saliency. Based on interviews with 23 people with color blindness we implemented four modes to help colorblind individuals distinguish colors they usually can't see. Although Glass still has important limitations, initial tests of Chroma in the lab show that colorblind individuals using Chroma can improve their color recognition in a variety of real-world activities. The deployment of Chroma on a wearable augmented-reality device makes it an effective digital aid with the potential to augment everyday activities, effectively providing access to different color dimensions for colorblind people.\",\n",

In this paper we surveyed the cognitive science literature as it applies to such visualization tasks, described experimental questions derived from these cognitive principles, and generated general guidelines that can be used in designing future OIV systems (as well improving AR displays more generally). Here we also report the results from an experiment that utilized a functioning AR-OIV system: we found that in a relative depth judgment, subjects reported rendered objects as being in front of real-world objects, except when additional occlusion and motion cues were presented together.\",\n",

These publications were classified in two different ways: according to the evaluation type used following an earlier literature survey classification scheme; and according to the evaluation methods or approach used. We present the results of out literature survey, provide a comprehensive list of references of the selected publications, and discuss some possible research opportunities for future work.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Neuronavigation has become an essential neurosurgical tool in pursuing minimal invasiveness and maximal safety, even though it has several technical limitations. Augmented reality (AR) neuronavigation is a significant advance, providing a real-time updated 3D virtual model of anatomical details, overlaid on the real surgical field. Currently, only a few AR systems have been tested in a clinical setting. The aim is to review such devices. We performed a PubMed search of reports restricted to human studies of in vivo applications of AR in any neurosurgical procedure using the search terms ``Augmented reality'' and ``Neurosurgery.'' Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers in an unblinded standardized manner. The systems were qualitatively evaluated on the basis of the following: neurosurgical subspecialty of application, pathology of treated lesions and lesion locations, real data source, virtual data source, tracking modality, registration technique, visualization processing, display type, and perception location. Eighteen studies were included during the period 1996 to September 30, 2015. The AR systems were grouped by the real data source: microscope (8), hand- or head-held cameras (4), direct patient view (2), endoscope (1), and X-ray fluoroscopy (1) head-mounted display (1). A total of 195 lesions were treated: 75 (38.46\\u00a0\\\\%) were neoplastic, 77 (39.48\\u00a0\\\\%) neurovascular, and 1 (0.51\\u00a0\\\\%) hydrocephalus, and 42 (21.53\\u00a0\\\\%) were undetermined. Current literature confirms that AR is a reliable and versatile tool when performing minimally invasive approaches in a wide range of neurosurgical diseases, although prospective randomized studies are not yet available and technical improvements are needed.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper presents and evaluates a set of pictorial depth cues for far-field outdoor mobile augmented reality (AR). We examine the problem of accurately placing virtual annotations at physical target points from a static point of view. While it is easy to line up annotations with a target point&#039;s projection in the view plane, finding the correct distance for the annotation is difficult if the target point is not represented in an environment model. We have found that AR depth cues, such as vertical and horizontal shadow planes, a small top-down map, or color encodings of relative depth, have a positive impact on a user&#039;s ability to align a 3D cursor with physical objects at various distances. These cues aid the user&#039;s depth perception and estimation by providing information about the 3D cursor&#039;s distance and its relationship in 3-space to any features that may already have been annotated. We conducted a user study that measures the effects of different depth cues for both absolute 3D cursor placement as well as placement relative to a small number of marked reference points, whose distances are known. Our study provides insight about mobile AR users &#039; ability to judge distances both absolutely and relatively, and we identify techniques that successfully enhance their performance. 1.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Understanding Augmented Reality addresses the elements that are required to create augmented reality experiences. The technology that supports augmented reality will come and go, evolve and change. The underlying principles for creating exciting, useful augmented reality experiences are timeless. Augmented reality designed from a purely technological perspective will lead to an AR experience that is novel and fun for one-time consumption - but is no more than a toy. Imagine a filmmaking book that discussed cameras and special effects software, but ignored cinematography and storytelling! In order to create compelling augmented reality experiences that stand the test of time and cause the participant in the AR experience to focus on the content of the experience - rather than the technology - one must consider how to maximally exploit the affordances of the medium. This book addresses core conceptual issues regarding the medium of augmented reality as well as the technology required to support compelling augmented reality. By addressing AR as a medium at the conceptual level in addition to the technological level, the reader will learn to conceive of AR applications that are not limited by today's technology. At the same time, ample examples are provided that show what is possible with current technology.\",\n",

The aim of this work is to assess how virtual and augmented reality interface paradigms can provide enhanced location based services using real-time techniques in the context of these two different technologies. The virtual reality interface is based on faithful graphical representation of the localities of interest, coupled with sensory information on the location and orientation of the user, while the augmented reality interface uses computer vision techniques to capture patterns from the real environment and overlay additional way-finding information, aligned with real imagery, in real-time. The knowledge obtained from the evaluation of the virtual reality navigational experience has been used to inform the design of the augmented reality interface. Initial results of the user testing of the experimental augmented reality system for navigation are presented.\",\n",

Users share a 3D virtual space and manipulate virtual objects that represent information to be discussed. We refer to EMMIE as a hybrid user interface because it combines a variety of different technologies and techniques, including virtual elements such as 3D widgets, and physical objects such as tracked displays and input devices. See-through head worn displays overlay the virtual environment on the physical environment, visualizing the pervasive \\\"virtual ether\\\" within which all interaction occurs.Our prototype includes additional 2D and 3D displays, ranging from palm-sized to wall-sized, allowing the most appropriate one to be used for any task. Objects can be moved among displays (including across dimensionalities) through drag & drop.In analogy to 2D window managers, we describe a prototype implementation of a shared 3D environment manager that is distributed across displays, machines, and operating systems. We also discuss two methods we are exploring for handling information privacy in such an environment.\",\n",

By view management, we mean maintaining visual constraints on the projections of objects on the view plane, such as locating related objects near each other, or preventing objects from occluding each other. Our view-management component accomplishes this by modifying selected object properties, including position, size, and transparency, which are tagged to indicate their constraints. For example, some objects may have geometric properties that are determined entirely by a physical simulation and which cannot be modified, while other objects may be annotations whose position and size are flexible. We introduce algorithms that use upright rectangular extents to represent on the view plane a dynamic and efficient approximation of the occupied space containing the projections of visible portions of 3D objects, as well as the unoccupied space in which objects can be placed to\",\n",

Starting with a total of 6071 publications we filtered the articles in several steps which resulted in 165 AR related publications with user evaluations. These publications were classified in two different ways: according to the evaluation type used following an earlier literature survey classification scheme; and according to the evaluation methods or approach used.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Augmented Reality (AR) can naturally complement mobile computing on wearable devices by providing an intuitive interface to a three-dimensional information space embedded within physical reality. However, existing AR systems like MARS 1 or Tinmith 2, which require a user to wear a notebook computer in a backpack and a head-mounted display (HMD) are expensive, fragile and inconvenient to wear. Thin-client approaches using a Tablet PC or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) merely as a portable display 34 require a dedicated server infrastructure and limit mobility. We believe there is a need for an unconstrained, infrastructureindependent AR display running to fill the gap in situations where traditional backpack systems are too costly and cumbersome, but thin client implementations exhibit inadequate deployability, scalability or interactive behavior. Particular examples include sporadic use over lengthy time spans, in between which devices must be stowed away, mixed indoor/outdoor use in wide-area environments, and massively multi-user application scenarios. This has motivated us to develop a state of the art AR framework targeting lightweight handheld displays.\",\n",

The system provides an augmented user interface with supporting information relevant to the welding process. The experimental studies focused on hand-eye coordination of welders and nonwelders with two prototypes of the augmented reality welding helmet. The first prototype operated at 16 frames per second, whereas the second, improved version had 20 frames per second. In addition, the hand-eye coordination while wearing the welding helmet with video see-through head-mounted display was compared to a performance with natural vision, without any helmet. Experimental results showed significant influence of helmet and occupation on hand-eye coordination. Subjective assessment revealed better rating for stereo perception for the system with the higher frame rate, whereas no significant difference in performance was found between the two frame rates.\",\n",

Once the 6 DOF pose is determined, 3D virtual objects from a database can be projected into the image and displayed for the mobile user. Off-line data acquisition consists of acquiring images at different locations in the environment. The online pose estimation is done by a feature-based matching between the cell phone image and an image selected from the precomputed database using the phone's sensors (accelerometer and magnetometer). The application enables the user both to visualize virtual objects in the camera image and to localize the user in a familiar environment. We describe in detail the process of building the database and the pose estimation algorithm used on the mobile phone. We evaluate the algorithm performance as well as its accuracy in terms of reprojection distance of the 3D virtual objects in the cell phone image.\",\n",

This paper presents a service framework and its applications for providing context-aware and adaptable 3D visualization and collaboration services for ubiquitous cars (U-cars) using augmented reality, which can support a rich set of ubiquitous car services and collaboration services for distributed maintenance and repair. It utilizes augmented reality for providing visual interactions by superimposing virtual models of car components or sub-assemblies onto real cars, which realizes bi-augmentation between physical and virtual models. It also offers a context processing module to acquire, interpret and disseminate context information. In particular, the context processing module considers user\\u2019s preferences for providing customer\\u2019s context adaptable services. The prototype system has been implemented to support 3D animation, text-to-speech (TTS), augmented manual, and pre- and post-augmentation services in ubiquitous car service environments.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Accurate assessment of nutrition information is an important part in the prevention and treatment of a multitude of diseases, but remains a challenging task. We present a novel mobile augmented reality application, which assists users in the nutrition assessment of their meals. Using the realtime camera image as a guide, the user overlays a 3D form of the food. Additionally the user selects the food type. The corresponding nutrition information is automatically computed. Thus accurate volume estimation is required for accurate nutrition information assessment. This work presents an evaluation of our mobile augmented reality approaches for portion estimation and offers a comparison to conventional portion estimation approaches. The comparison is performed on the basis of a user study (n=28). The quality of nutrition assessment is measured based on the error in energy units. In the results of the evaluation one of our mobile augmented reality approaches significantly outperforms all other methods. Additionally we present results on the efficiency and effectiveness of the approaches.\",\n",

In addition to acting as a physical controller that recognizes multiple game-dependent gestures, the mobile device augments the camera view with graphical overlays.

This paper reports on a collaborative user study, in which a local worker is guided by a remote expert with the help of different augmented reality methods, specifically see-through HMD, spatial projection, and video-mixing tablet. The performed task is an controller exchange in a switch cabinet of an industrial robot, a task rather typical for failure detection within the field. Our study was conducted in collaboration with a technician school of which 50 technician apprentices participated in our study. Our results show clear advantages of using augmented reality (AR) versus traditional conditions (audio, video, screenshot) to enable remote support. It further gives significant indications for using a projection based AR method.\",\n",

Thus, we introduce and discuss the new concept of interactive augmented television, i. e. real time composition of video and computer graphics - e.g. a real scene and freely selectable images or spatial rendered objects - edited and customized by the end user within the context of the user's set top box and TV receiver.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe demonstrate a sample application introducing \\\"Interactive Augmented Television\\\" for sport broadcasts additionally with 3D virtual objects in order to enhance or alter the presentation of the match with a new interface. We also introduce a pure virtual world where the user can select the camera position.\",\n",

But which mixed reality method leads to better results regarding human factors, grounding and per- formance criteria? This paper reports on a collaborative user study, in which a local worker is guided by a remote expert with the help of different augmented reality methods, specifically see-through HMD, spatial projection, and video-mixing tablet. The performed task is an controller exchange in a switch cabinet of an industrial robot, a task rather typical for failure detection within the field. Our study was conducted in collaboration with a technician school of which 50 technician apprentices participated in our study. Our results show clear advantages of using augmented reality (AR) versus traditional conditions (audio, video, screenshot) to enable remote support. It further gives significant indications for using a projection based AR method.\",\n",

The system allows multiple users to experience a shared 3D workspace populated by multiple applications using see-through head mounted displays or other presentation media such as projection systems. The system design is based on a distributed shared scene graph that alleviates the application programmer from explicitly considering distribution, and avoids a separation of graphical and application data. The idea of unifying all system data in the scene graph is taken to its logical consequence by implementing application instances as nodes in the scene graph. Through the distributed shared scene graph mechanism, consistency of scene graph replicas and the contained application nodes is assured. Multi-user 3D widgets allow concurrent interaction with minimal coordination effort from the application. Special interest is paid to migration of application nodes from host to host allowing dynamic workgroup management, such as load balancing, late joining and early exit of hosts, and some firms of ubiquitous computing\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Augmented Reality (AR) can naturally complement mobile computing on wearable devices by providing an intuitive interface to a three-dimensional information space embedded within physical reality. Unfortunately, current wearable AR systems are relatively complex, expensive, fragile and heavy, rendering them unfit for large-scale deployment involving untrained users outside constrained laboratory environments. Consequently, the scale of collaborative multi-user experiments have not yet exceeded a handful of participants. In this paper, we present a system architecture for interactive, infrastructure-independent multi-user AR applications running on off-the-shelf handheld devices. We implemented a four-user interactive game installation as an evaluation setup to encourage playful engagement of participants in a cooperative task. Over the course of five weeks, more than five thousand visitors from a wide range of professional and socio-demographic backgrounds interacted with our system at four different locations.\",\n",

The system features face-to-face communication, collaborative viewing and manipulation of 3D models, and seamless access to 2D desktop applications within the shared 3D space. All virtual content, including 3D models and 2D desktop windows, is attached to tracked physical objects in order to leverage the efficiencies of natural two-handed manipulation. The presence of 2D desktop space within 3D facilitates data exchange between the two realms, enables control of 3D information by 2D applications, and generally increases productivity by providing access to familiar tools. We present a general concept for a collaborative tangible AR system, including a comprehensive set of interaction techniques, a distributed hardware setup, and a component-based software architecture that can be flexibly configured using XML. We show the validity of our concept with an implementation of an application scenario from the automotive industry.\",\n",

The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Upon the popularity of 3C devices, the visual creatures are all around us, such the online game, touch pad, video and animation. Therefore, the text-based web page will no longer satisfy users. With the popularity of webcam, digital camera, stereoscopic glasses, or head-mounted display, the user interface becomes more visual and multi-dimensional. For the consideration of 3D and visual display in the research of web user interface design, Augmented Reality technology providing the convenient tools and impressive effects becomes the hot topic. Augmented Reality effect enables users to represent parts of the digital objects on top of the physical surroundings. The easy operation with webcam greatly improving the visual representation of web pages becomes the interest of our research. Therefore, we apply Augmented Reality technology for developing a city tour web site to collect the opinions of users. Therefore, the website stickiness is an important measurement. The major tasks of the work include the exploration of Augmented Reality technology and the evaluation of the outputs of Augmented Reality. The feedback opinions of users are valuable references for improving AR application in the work. As a result, the AR increasing the visual and interactive effects of web page encourages users to stay longer and more than 80\\\\% of users are willing to return for visiting the website soon. Moreover, several valuable conclusions about Augmented Reality technology in web user interface design are also provided for further practical references.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The range of most Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality systems is usually constrained to laboratories by the limited range of a single expensive 6DOF tracking system. Our Ubiquitous Tracking (Ubitrack) approach seeks to overcome this limitation, not by extending the range of a single tracker, but by dynamically incorporating a number of heterogeneous sensors. The Ubitrack tool set consists of Spatial Relationship Graphs (SRGs), which allow for a formal specification of tracking environments, and Spatial Relationship Patterns, which are used to derive data flow configurations by systematic analysis of the SRG. This formal framework supports a distributed software architecture, where clients efficiently produce, transform, transmit and consume tracking data, coordinated by a Ubitrack server. In this document, we discuss both theoretical and implementational aspects and illustrate the new possibilities on a scenario, where a mobile AR user is guided through a building using a diverse and changing set of sensors.\",\n",

Therefore, recommendations relating to the optimal representation size of virtual information for an head mounted display with see through mode, which is used for Augmented Reality, cannot be given at the moment. In order to apply this new technology successfully to an industrial area, such information is urgently necessary. For this reason, three different kinds of displays were tested in this study regarding human information perception.

Researchers have solved many technical challenges during that time, finally allowing practical access to this user interface. While early AR research focused on head-mounted displays and backpack computers, it now encompasses a variety of enabling technologies, including camera phones and other handhelds, advanced projector-camera systems, and AR-extended professional devices, such as x-ray scanners. It is this evolution that has finally made it possible to use AR in our daily lives. Although AR's practical applications have not yet reached the level that many people involved in the field have dreamed of, the number of these applications is steadily increasing. Beyond what has been published about AR in the scientific literature and the lay press, current research in the field poses some exciting questions: What's real about augmented reality? What role does it play for all of us today, and what impact will it potentially have on society in the future? Will there be a killer app for AR, or will the AR bubble finally burst? Currently, the areas in which AR seems to do very well include entertainment, education, advertising/marketing, and medicine. Where will it go from here?\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"One claim of Learning-enhancing technologies is to support and exploit benefits from distance learning and remote collaboration. On the other hand, several approaches to learning emphasize the importance of hands-on experience. Unfortunately, these two goals don't go well together with taditional learning techniques. Even though TEL technologies can alleviate this problem, it is not sufficiently solved yet - remote collaboration usually comes at the cost of losing direct hands-on access. The ARiSE project aims at bringing Augmented Reality to School Environments, a technology that can potentially bridge the gap between these goals. The project has designed, implemented and evaluated a pedagogical reference scenario where students work hands-on together over large distances. The paper describes the AR learning approach we followed and discusses its potantial and implementation. It concludes with findings obtained during field tests.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Numerous Studies and new applications like Google Expeditions or Anatomy 4D point to a great potential of Augmented and Virtual Reality for its use for educational purposes. However, related research concerning technology integration in the classroom has shown that a valuable medium alone does not automatically lead to its successful use. It is therefore the aim of the paper to present an approach by which competencies of pre-service teachers for a successful and appropriate integration of Augmented and Virtual Reality-applications in the classroom are fostered - the own design of Augmented and Virtual Reality applications. We will begin with a short discussion of prominent findings and related work in regard to teaching and learning with and about Augmented and Virtual Reality in the first part before introducing the main goals and aspects of the presented pedagogical concept and the seminar in the second part of the paper. In the third part, two applications created in the seminar and qualitative data from an explorative study based on focus group interviews and participant observation will be presented. We close with a discussion of our findings and an outlook to future work.\",\n",

In this development the question of 2D to 3D viewing aids arises. For the experiment an integrated helmet with two High-Dynamic Range Camerias (HDRC) and a closed view stereoscopic head-mounted display was used. The experimental task was to position pegs on a pegboard. Alignment angles of the cameras and inter-camera separation distances were varied under the different experimental conditions. It was found that a convergent alignment of the cameras resulted in less mistakes and higher speed. An effect of the inter-camera separation was found in 3D-perception, suggesting the advantage of smaller distances.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This article investigates the effects of different XR displays on the\\r\\nperception and plausibility of personalized virtual humans. We compared immersive virtual reality (VR), video see-through augmented reality (VST AR), and optical see-through AR (OST AR). The personalized virtual alter egos were generated by state-of-the-art photogrammetry methods. 42 participants were repeatedly exposed to animated versions of their 3D-reconstructed virtual alter egos in each of the three XR display conditions. The reconstructed virtual alter egos were additionally modified in body weight for each repetition. We show that the display types lead to different degrees of incongruence between the renderings of the virtual humans and the presentation of the respective environmental backgrounds, leading to significant effects of perceived mismatches as part of a plausibility measurement. The device-related effects were further partly confirmed by subjective misestimations of the modified body weight and the measured spatial presence. Here, the exceedingly incongruent OST AR condition leads to the significantly highest weight misestimations as well as to the lowest perceived spatial presence. However, similar effects could not be confirmed for the affective appraisal (i.e., humanness, eeriness, or attractiveness) of the virtual humans, giving rise to the assumption that these factors might be unrelated to each other.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"While the knowledge economy has reshaped the world, schools lag behind in producing appropriate learning for this social change. Science education needs to prepare students for a future world in which multiple representations are the norm and adults are required to  think like scientists.  Location-based augmented reality games offer an opportunity to create a  post-progressive  pedagogy in which students are not only immersed in authentic scientific inquiry, but also required to perform in adult scientific discourses. This cross-case comparison as a component of a design-based research study investigates three cases (roughly 28 students total) where an Augmented Reality curriculum, Mad City Mystery, was used to support learning in environmental science. We investigate whether augmented reality games on handhelds can be used to engage students in scientific thinking (particularly argumentation), how game structures affect students\\u2019 thinking, the impact of role playing on learning, and the role of the physical environment in shaping learning. We argue that such games hold potential for engaging students in meaningful scientific argumentation. Through game play, players are required to develop narrative accounts of scientific phenomena, a process that requires them to develop and argue scientific explanations. We argue that specific game features scaffold this thinking process, creating supports for student thinking non-existent in most inquiry-based learning environments.\",\n",

The high amount of data collected with LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data for realistic rendering and simulation problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to be transformed into representations that fulfill the computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In this tutorial participants will be introduced to state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing and surface reconstruction with open source software to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by interleaved presentations, software demonstrations and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in C/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes and other meshing methods will play another central role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering, segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface reconstruction will be provided. Participants are invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical problems occuring when working with large scale 3D point clouds in VR and AR applications.\",\n",

The aims of the 6 th Sense project are to improve real-time interaction between the real environment and the virtual world and to maximize the user experience in mobile Augmented Reality. To achieve these objectives a generic framework constituted of two main layers is proposed. The End-to-End Adaptation Layer adapts in real-time the parameters of the Augmented Reality system to provide the user with the best possible experience despite the varying operating conditions such as the transmission link and user head motion. The Generic Augmented Reality Layer encompasses solutions to the problem of overlaying adequate information in the real scene and manages multimodal interaction with the virtual environment.\",\n",

The addition of haptic (force and/or tactile) feedback has been proposed as a way to further enhance the performance of these systems. However, due to limitations in sensing and control technologies, implementing direct haptic feedback to the surgeon's hands remains impractical for clinical application. A new, intuitive augmented reality system for presentation of force information through sensory substitution has been developed and evaluated. The augmented reality system consists of force-sensing robotic instruments, a kinematic tool tracker, and a graphic display that overlays a visual representation of force levels on top of the moving instrument tips. The system is integrated with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) and tested by several users in a phantom knot tying task. The augmented reality system decreases the number of broken sutures, decreases the number of loose knots, and results in more consistent application of forces.\",\n",

This new application of AR-technology is called ARsembly. The intention of this article is to describe a typical scenario for assembly and service personnel and how they might be supported by AR. For this purpose, tasks with different degrees of difficulty were selected from an authentic assembly process. In addition, two other kinds of assembly support media (a paper manual and a tutorial by an expert) were examined in order to compare them with ARsembly. The results showed that the assembly times varied according to the different support conditions. AR-support proved to be more suitable for difficult tasks than the paper manual, whereas for easier tasks, the use of a paper manual did not differ significantly from AR-support. Tasks done under the guidance of an expert, were completed most rapidly. Some of the information obtained in this investigation also indicated important considerations for improving future ARsembly applications.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Augmented Reality is on the rise with consumer-grade smart glasses becoming available in recent years. Those interested in deploying these head-mounted displays need to understand better the effect technology has on the end user. One key aspect potentially hindering the use is motion sickness, a known problem inherited from virtual reality, which so far remains under-explored. In this paper we address this problem by conducting an experiment with 142 subjects in three different industries: aviation, medical, and space. We evaluate whether the Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality head-mounted display, causes simulator sickness and how different symptom groups contribute to it (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation). Our findings suggest that the Microsoft HoloLens causes across all participants only negligible symptoms of simulator sickness. Most consumers who use it will face no symptoms while only few experience minimal discomfort in the training environments we tested it in.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are two developing technologies with enormous promise to change the way education is provided. The purpose of this research is to investigate the fundamental distinctions between AR and VR in the context of course instruction. Educators can acquire insights into how these technologies might be effectively integrated into the classroom by evaluating their specific traits, affordances, and limits. The research begins by defining AR and VR and then compares their key ideas. AR superimposes digital information on the real-world environment to improve the user's impression of reality, whereas VR immerses users in a simulated environment to create a sensation of presence and immersion. These contrasts lay the groundwork for comprehending their disparate uses in education. The study then goes into the educational benefits and difficulties of AR and VR. AR allows students to interact with digital information in real time, encouraging engagement, collaboration, and contextualized learning. It could bridge the gap between abstract ideas and real-world applications. VR, on the other hand, provides an immersive and regulated environment that allows students to explore complicated scenarios, imitate real-world circumstances, and acquire important skills in a safe and cost-effective manner. The research looks at the technology needs, accessibility concerns, and implementation techniques for AR and VR in educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of pedagogical design, content creation, and teacher training to maximize these technologies' educational impact. This review paper investigates the differences between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in the context of course education. AR and VR have emerged as significant tools for boosting the learning experience as technology continues to alter education. Understanding the distinct characteristics and benefits of each technology is critical for educators to make educated judgments about how to include them in their teaching practices. This paper examines AR and VR in depth, concentrating on their distinctions, uses, and possible influence in educational contexts.\",\n",

These synthetic receptors offer complimentary information on our surroundings and endow us with novel means of manipulating physical or even virtual objects. We realize highly compliant magnetosensitive skins with directional perception that enable magnetic cognition, body position tracking, and touchless object manipulation. Transfer printing of eight high-performance spin valve sensors arranged into two Wheatstone bridges onto 1.7-\\u03bcm-thick polyimide foils ensures mechanical imperceptibility. This resembles a new class of interactive devices extracting information from the surroundings through magnetic tags. We demonstrate this concept in augmented reality systems with virtual knob-turning functions and the operation of virtual dialing pads, based on the interaction with magnetic fields. This technology will enable a cornucopia of applications from navigation, motion tracking in robotics, regenerative medicine, and sports and gaming to interaction in supplemented reality.\",\n",

We present two AR-based case studies: First, a mobile AR architecture based on optical see through glasses is used for an on-site local repair task. Second, a remote architecture based on a portable tablet PC and a high precision tracking system is used to realize an off-site expert access. The to-be-serviced machine is visualized inside of a large area similar to a machinery hall and can be inspected by the experts walking around this virtual plant using the tablet and perspectively correct rendering to understand the production process and the operation context.

However, relatively little is known about the potential of this technology to support teaching and learning with groups of young children in the classroom. Analysis of teacher\\u2013child dialogue in a comparative study between use of an AR virtual mirror interface and more traditional science teaching methods for 10-year-old children, revealed that the children using AR were less engaged than those using traditional resources. We suggest four design requirements that need to be considered if AR is to be successfully adopted into classroom practice. These requirements are: flexible content that teachers can adapt to the needs of their children, guided exploration so learning opportunities can be maximised, in a limited time, and attention to the needs of institutional and curricular requirements.\",\n",

When Augmented Reality (AR) experience is delivered on mobile devices it is termed as mobile augmented reality (MAR). MAR is state-of-the-art technology that has completely revolutionized the way of accessing and interacting with information thus invoking new experiences for users all around the world. This article is an effort to summarize the current research regarding user experience of MAR. Mobile AR Publications of past 10 years are identified for a preliminary review from prominent online databases and digital libraries. The aim of this study is to identify the areas of User Experience (UX) that lack research. We present a classification of present UX research in MAR domain. Research findings and possible opportunities for future research are also discussed.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"According to Google Trends, mobile augmented reality (AR) apps will, after a brief hype-associated peak and decline, show again a more steady growth in the near future. Indeed, a review of currently available mobile AR apps suggests that they are embracing practical uses instead of simply showing off the capabilities of AR. Many of these apps are making information more ubiquitous without making the user necessarily aware of the data's origins, using graphics to represent multiple datasets. There has been however little research focusing on the trends in AR and the types of data visualisations used in mobile AR. The purpose of this paper is to fill that void by presenting an analysis of currently popular mobile AR apps on the market. Our findings from this small-scale investigation give an indication of the types of visualisation styles used in current mobile AR apps and highlight suggestions for how to make the information presented more relevant, for example by using better filtering methods.\",\n",

Among the challenges is the general problem of capturing the larger context in interaction from the perspective of user modeling and human\\u2013computer interaction (HCI). The imperative to address this issue is great considering the emergence of ubiquitous and mobile computing environments. This paper provides an account of our addressing the specific problem of supporting functionality as well as the experience design issues related to museum visits through user modeling in combination with an audio augmented reality and tangible user interface system. This paper details our deployment and evaluation of ec(h)o \\u2013 an augmented audio reality system for museums. We explore the possibility of supporting a context-aware adaptive system by linking environment, interaction objects and users at an abstract semantic level instead of at the content level. From the user modeling perspective ec(h)o is a knowledge-based recommender system. In this paper we present our findings from user testing and how our approach works well with an audio and tangible user interface within a ubiquitous computing system. We conclude by showing where further research is needed.\",\n",

The system allows shapes that carry contextual meanings for humans to be used as Augmented Reality (AR) tracking targets. The user can teach the system new shapes in real time. New shapes can be shown to the system frontally, or they can be automatically rectified according to previously learned shapes. Shapes can be automatically assigned virtual content by classification according to a shape class library. Nestor performs shape recognition by analyzing contour structures and generating projective-invariant signatures from their concavities. The concavities are further used to extract features for pose estimation and tracking. Pose refinement is carried out by minimizing the reprojection error between sample points on each image contour and its library counterpart. Sample points are matched by evolving an active contour in real time. Our experiments show that the system provides stable and accurate registration, and runs at interactive frame rates on a Nokia N95 mobile phone.\",\n",

We argue that such games hold potential for engaging\\n\\tstudents in meaningful scientific argumentation. Through game play,\\n\\tplayers are required to develop narrative accounts of scientific\\n\\tphenomena, a process that requires them to develop and argue scientific\\n\\texplanations. We argue that specific game features scaffold this\\n\\tthinking process, creating supports for student thinking non-existent\\n\\tin most inquiry-based learning environments.\",\n",

We researched effectiveness and user preferences of different interaction modalities for notifications, along with two types of notification display methods. In our study, participants were immersed in a simulated cooking environment using an AR-HMD, where they had to fulfill customer orders. During the cooking process, participants received notifications related to customer orders and ingredient updates. They were given three interaction modes for those notifications: voice commands, eye gaze and dwell, and hand gestures. To manage multiple notifications at once, we also researched two different notification list displays, one attached to the user\\u2019s hand and one in the world. Results indicate that participants preferred using their hands to interact with notifications and having the list of notifications attached to their hands. Voice and gaze interaction was perceived as having lower usability than touch.\",\n",

Es ist m\\u00f6glich, dass trotz hoher praktischer Akzeptanz ein System nicht genutzt wird, da dieses sozial nicht akzeptabel ist. F\\u00fcr Augmented-Reality-Datenbrillen (AR-Datenbrillen) wurden schon verschiedene Faktoren determiniert, welche die soziale Akzeptanz beeinflussen k\\u00f6nnen, um zu vermeiden, dass diese von den Nutzern abgelehnt werden. Ein wichtiger Faktor, welcher die soziale Akzeptanz einer Datenbrille beeinflussen kann, ist die Interaktionsart. Es ist anzunehmen, dass die Verwendung unterschiedlicher Interaktionsarten in dem gleichen sozialen Kontext mit dem gleichen Gesamtsystem nicht in der gleichen sozialen Akzeptanz resultiert. Nachfolgend wird eine Studie mit 10 Probanden und 6 aktuell auf AR-Datenbrillen verwendeten Interaktionsarten durchgef\\u00fchrt, um deren soziale Akzeptanz in verschiedenen Orts- und Zuschauerkontexten vergleichend zu evaluieren. Die Studie zeigt, dass die Interaktionsarten, insbesondere diverse Arten der Sprachinteraktion, mit steigender Distanz der sozialen Beziehung zu dem Zuschauer in der Bewertung degradieren und, dass der Ort des voraussichtlichen Einsatzes der Interaktionsart ber\\u00fccksichtigt werden muss.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Separating and recycling waste is an important topic to protect our environment and achieve a more sustainable future. However, recycling also is a complex process, as each type of waste needs a specific recycling method. This comes along with multiple recycling containers, each relevant for one specific type of waste. Ensuring a correct recycling process therefore not only requires specific infrastructure, but also a respective attitude and knowledge of the population. Stressing the need for an accessible educational opportunity addressing waste separation, we present a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application that guides a user through a recycling process and hence scaffolds the learning of proper recycling of each type of waste. The app further provides a prototypical implementation of a product scanner, that identifies the waste type based on a marker and assists the recycling on a case-by-case decision. Using self-determination theory as a framework, we integrated gamification elements, aiming for enhanced need satisfaction, motivation and user experience. In a user study, we compared the gamified version to a control version, with both app versions yielding a high acceptance, user experience, and waste separation behavior. This indicates the importance of providing easy-to-use mobile apps allowing for a learning and assistance of proper recycling.\",\n",

Due to technological advancements, holographic augmented reality (AR) mirrors can create realistic visualizations of virtual humans that can represent one's appearance in an altered way while remaining in a familiar environment. Further developing those mirrors opens a new field for use in everyday life. In this work, we outline possible future scenarios where AR mirrors can empower individuals to visualize their emotions, thought patterns, and discrepancies related to their physical body and mental body image. Thus, AR mirrors can encourage their self-reflection, promote a positive and healthy relationship with their bodies, or motivate them to take action to improve their well-being.\",\n",

The three tasks are a visual stimulus-response task (VSRT), a simple walking task and a walking obstacle course. Also, we investigate the effects of different AR text positions on primary task and reading performance as well as subjective preference. We propose a novel out of sight body-locked text placement for AR text presentation to be used in dual-task situations and compare it to head-locked text placement, each in two heights. AR reading affected performance in all tasks and reading speed was affected in all dual-task conditions. Participants subjectively preferred the body-locked text presentation, while objective measures do not reflect that preference. Differences between the tasks and several interaction effects between task and AR text placement demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the context of use when designing AR reading UIs. The presented study with 12 participants provides insights into the effects of AR glasses usage in dual-task situations and several design recommendations are derived from the results.\",\n",

To integrate AR in the everyday classroom, teachers need to be capable of designing their own immersive experiences for their students, which is why an analysis of existing authoring toolkits is necessary to identify suitable tools for educational application development and future research directions in terms of educational AR. We identified \\u201ceasy access\\u201d, \\u201cGUI-based design\\u201d, and \\u201cinteractive contents\\u201d as needs of teachers for designing AR content for the classroom. Based on these needs, we conducted a literature review of 835 documents. Of 80 relevant articles, we included 43 peer-reviewed articles from ACM Digital Library, DBLP, IEEExplore, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and miscellaneous other sources in our analysis. We identified 69 different AR authoring toolkits and classified these with regard to their accessibility, their degree of required programming knowledge, and their interactivity. The results show a divergent research landscape with a lack of empirical evaluation. Of 26 openly accessible toolkits, we identified five toolkits addressing the defined needs of teachers for designing interactive AR experiences for the classroom without requiring extensive programming knowledge. We conclude that there are only few tools for the straightforward design of educational AR experiences addressing the needs of teachers and suggest using research-informed and evidence-based criteria for developing AR authoring toolkits for education.\",\n",

In such contexts, it is particularly important to display information without obscuring essential areas of central vision. Information can, thus, be presented to the peripheral vision. The objective of the present study was to investigate how peripheral visual cues should be displayed in AR to achieve efficient perception during walking. We conducted a pilot study and tested three different versions of directional cues presented while walking or standing still: simply popping up, moving towards the indicated direction, or changing color. The results indicated that the perception of peripheral cues in AR is generally less efficient while walking than standing still. Within the walking condition, the color-changing cue was perceived best.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Durch eine zunehmend flexibilisierte Produktion und relativ hohe Personalfluktuation bei einfachen T\\u00e4tigkeiten wird das Anlernen neuer Mitarbeitender bzw. f\\u00fcr neue oder ge\\u00e4nderte Produktionsprozesse zunehmend relevanter. Konventionelle Anlernmethoden, bspw. durch Demonstration oder Arbeitspl\\u00e4ne, haben Schw\\u00e4chen (bspw. binden sie zus\\u00e4tzliche Arbeitskraft oder sind kognitiv anspruchsvoll), die durch ein Augmented-Reality-(AR-)basiertes Assistenzsystem kompensiert werden k\\u00f6nnen. Ein AR-Assistenzsystem zum Anlernen eines tats\\u00e4chlichen industriellen Montageprozesses wurde in einer vergleichenden Studie mit 16 Versuchspersonen gegen\\u00fcber einer konventionellen Papieranleitung evaluiert. Bzgl. Gebrauchstauglichkeit und Beanspruchung deuten sich die St\\u00e4rken des AR-Ansatzes an. In den Subskalen Anstrengung und Frustration zeigt sich eine statistisch signifikante Reduktion der Beanspruchung. Bez\\u00fcglich der Montagezeiten konnten statistisch signifikante Vorteile erzielt werden. Erg\\u00e4nzend wurde in einer zweiten Studie eine Videoanleitung mit der AR-Anleitung verglichen.\\r\\nPraktische Relevanz: Die Digitalisierung der Produktion erlaubt nach Kundenwunsch individualisierte Produkte, die mit einer flexibilisierten Produktion einhergehen. Einfache Montageprozesse \\u00e4ndern sich daher h\\u00e4ufiger vollst\\u00e4ndig oder in Teilen. Au\\u00dferdem wechseln Mitarbeitende aufgrund der monotonen und repetitiven T\\u00e4tigkeiten h\\u00e4ufiger. All das f\\u00fchrt zu einem Bedarf an regelm\\u00e4\\u00dfigen Anlernprozessen. Ein AR-Assistenzsystem erscheint als aussichtsreicher Ansatz, wobei die Gebrauchstauglichkeit besonders im Fokus stehen sollte, da wenig technische Kenntnisse vorausgesetzt werden k\\u00f6nnen.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This thesis explores potentials of applying spatial visuo-proprioceptive conflicts of the real hand to 3D user interaction in Augmented Reality. A generic framework is proposed which can generate, manage and reduce sensory conflicts at hand level while providing a continuous interaction cycle. Technically, the system is based on a video see-through head-mounted display that allows for embedding the real hand into a virtual scene and to visually manipulate its position in 3D. Two novel methods are introduced on top of this basis: an intuitive virtual object touching paradigm and a hand-displacement-based active pseudo-haptics technique. Both approaches are studied with respect to their benefits, limitations, effects on the behaviour of the user and consequences for the design of Virtual Environments. It is demonstrated that new forms of human-computer interaction are possible exploiting the described visuomotor conflicts of the hand. Promising future perspectives are presented.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Against the background of the research-based assumption that student motivation is a key factor for successful teaching and learning processes, the following paper presents results from a study evaluating the role of student motivation in Augmented Reality (AR)-enhanced gamified STEM learning settings. In the study, an international sample of 1988 primary school students and 91 teachers used an AR-enhanced gamified STEM learning app (intervention group) or traditional teaching and learning approaches (control group). Student motivation and performance were assessed in a pre and post test design and teachers\\u2019 opinions were recorded using online surveys. The results indicate that students and teachers in the intervention group considered the motivational impact of the AR-enhanced gamified app significantly higher, compared to the ratings for alternative media in the control group. The product-moment correlation between motivation and further variables, such as student attitudes and self-efficacy, showed significant, medium strong results which are comparably high in intervention and control group. Only in the intervention group, motivation and learning achievement were correlated. Students and teachers in the intervention group tended to agree on the motivational impact of the study phase while a correlation between the opinions of teachers and students in the control group could not be confirmed. Overall, the study provides evidence of the pedagogical usefulness of AR-enhanced gamified STEM learning applications in terms of supporting student motivation, based on findings from a large international sample.\",\n",

Teachers are central stakeholders in the educational use of AR; given their daily classroom practice, they are also experts in the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of respective innovative educational technologies. Yet, few studies systematically analysed teachers\\u2019 opinions and experiences about the advantages and problems in the educational use of AR technologies so far. In response to this desideratum, the following paper presents results from a systematic and category-based qualitative content analysis based on an interview study. The input was collected from a heterogeneous and international convenience sample of n=11 teachers after they had piloted one out of three AR-enhanced learning apps in their daily classroom practice. The results confirm that increased student motivation and classroom engagement and advanced learning achievements are considered the predominant advantages and that issues with software and technology were perceived as the biggest problems in the pilot study. Furthermore, dimensions of motivation and classroom engagement are considered in detail to achieve an in-depth analysis and to bring forward important recommendations for further developments and for teachers\\u2019 future educational use of AR technologies.\",\n",

The results are obtained from the feedback of 160 participants who performed the same repair task on a switch cabinet of an industrial robot. The studies compare several AR instruction applications on different display devices (head-mounted display, handheld tablet PC and projection-based spatial AR) with baseline conditions (paper instructions and phone support), both in a single-user and a collaborative setting. Next to insights on the performance of the individual device types for the single mode operation, the study is able to show significant indications on AR techniques are being especially helpful in a collaborative setting.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Augmented reality (AR) environments are suffering from a\\r\\n                 limited workspace. In addition, registration issues are\\r\\n                 also increased by the use of a mobile camera on the user\\r\\n                 that provides a first-person perspective (1PP). Using\\r\\n                 several fixed cameras reduces the registration issues\\r\\n                 and, depending on their location, the workspace could\\r\\n                 also be enlarged. In this case of an extended workspace,\\r\\n                 it has been shown that third-person perspective (3PP) is\\r\\n                 sometimes preferred by the user. Based on the previous\\r\\n                 hypotheses, we developed a system working with several\\r\\n                 fixed cameras that can provide 3PP to a user wearing a\\r\\n                 video see-through HMD. Our system uses an ``intelligent\\r\\n                 switch'' to propose our ``best view'' to the user, i.e.\\r\\n                 avoiding markers occlusion and taking into account user\\r\\n                 displacements. We present in this paper, such a system,\\r\\n                 its decision algorithm, and the discussion of obtained\\r\\n                 results that seem to be very promising within the AR\\r\\n                 domain.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The embodiment of avatars in virtual reality (VR) is a promising tool for enhancing the user's mental health. A great example is the treatment of body image disturbances, where eliciting a full-body illusion can help identify, visualize, and modulate persisting misperceptions. Augmented reality (AR) could complement recent advances in the field by incorporating real elements, such as the therapist or the user's real body, into therapeutic scenarios. However, research on the use of AR in this context is very sparse. Therefore, we present a holographic AR mirror system based on an optical see-through (OST) device and markerless body tracking, collect valuable qualitative feedback regarding its user experience, and compare quantitative results regarding presence, embodiment, and body weight perception to similar systems using video see-through (VST) AR and VR. For our OST AR system, a total of 27 normal-weight female participants provided predominantly positive feedback on display properties (field of view, luminosity, and transparency of virtual objects), body tracking, and the perception of the avatar\\u2019s appearance and movements. In the quantitative comparison to the VST AR and VR systems, participants reported significantly lower feelings of presence, while they estimated the body weight of the generic avatar significantly higher when using our OST AR system. For virtual body ownership and agency, we found only partially significant differences. In summary, our study shows the general applicability of OST AR in the given context offering huge potential in future therapeutic scenarios. However, the comparative evaluation between OST AR, VST AR, and VR also revealed significant differences in relevant measures. Future work is mandatory to corroborate our findings and to classify the significance in a therapeutic context.\",\n",

Indeed, everyday walking in complex environments utilizes executive function, dual tasking, planning and scanning, all while walking forward. Pilot studies suggest that a multi-modal intervention that combines treadmill training to target motor function and a virtual reality obstacle course to address the cognitive components of fall risk may be used to successfully address the motor-cognitive interactions that are fundamental for fall risk reduction. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on fall risk.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Background: Imprecise carbohydrate counting as a measure to guide the treatment of diabetes may be a source of errors resulting in problems in glycemic control. Exact measurements can be tedious, leading most patients to estimate their carbohydrate intake. In the presented pilot study a smartphone application (BEAR), that guides the estimation of the amounts of carbohydrates, was used by a group of diabetic patients. Methods: Eight adult patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 were recruited for the study. At the beginning of the study patients were introduced to BEAR in sessions lasting 45 minutes per patient. Patients redraw the real food in 3D on the smartphone screen. Based on a selected food type and the 3D form created using BEAR an estimation of carbohydrate content is calculated. Patients were supplied with the application on their personal smartphone or a loaner device and were instructed to use the application in real-world context during the study period. For evaluation purpose a test measuring carbohydrate estimation quality was designed and performed at the beginning and the end of the study. Results: In 44% of the estimations performed at the end of the study the error reduced by at least 6 grams of carbohydrate. This improvement occurred albeit several problems with the usage of BEAR were reported. Conclusions: Despite user interaction problems in this group of patients the provided intervention resulted in a reduction in the absolute error of carbohydrate estimation. Intervention with smartphone applications to assist carbohydrate counting apparently results in more accurate estimations.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This article compares two state-of-the-art text input techniques between non-stationary virtual reality (VR) and video see-through augmented reality (VST AR) use-cases as XR display condition. The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and wordgesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The paper describes two experiments for investigating the influence of different levels of camera displacement on hand-eye coordination while using a video see-through head-mounted display. During the first experiment 15 camera positions with five levels of height displacement and three levels of depth displacement were compared in four different tasks. Using a two-way ANOVA the comparison of the calculated performance characteristic values showed significant influence of height displacement on hand-eye coordination. In conclusion cameras should be placed above or below eye level, but by no more than 35 mm, in order to preserve hand-eye coordination. In the second experiment, a mirror system was used to check hand-eye coordination in an exemplary medical task allowing the cameras to be placed virtually at eye level. A significant decrease in accuracy was found while using the head-mounted display compared to direct view. Finally, the mirror system was compared to the 15 camera positions using the data from the same tasks. Significant differences in performance were found between the mirror system and eye level position as well as the position slightly below eye level. The results of the experiment provide design recommendations for developers and users of video see-through systems.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The rapid development of 3D scanning technology combined\\n                  with state-of-the-art mapping algorithms allows to\\n                  capture 3D point clouds with high resolution and\\n                  accuracy. The high amount of data collected with\\n                  LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM\\n                  approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data\\n                  for realistic rendering and simulation\\n                  problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to\\n                  be transformed into representations that fulfill the\\n                  computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In\\n                  this tutorial participants will be introduced to\\n                  state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing\\n                  and surface reconstruction with open source software\\n                  to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by\\n                  interleaved presentations, software demonstrations\\n                  and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point\\n                  cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d\\n                  trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in\\n                  C/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes\\n                  and other meshing methods will play another central\\n                  role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point\\n                  cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering,\\n                  segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface\\n                  reconstruction will be provided. Participants are\\n                  invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows\\n                  laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical\\n                  problems occuring when working with large scale 3D\\n                  point clouds in VR and AR applications.\",\n",

Weiterhin haben wir gesehen, was Tracking ist und wie man damit Systeme aufsetzen kann, die virtuelle Objekte an der gew\\u00fcnschten Position darstellen. Mit anderen Worten kann man sagen, dass wir fast ausschlie\\u00dflich die Ausgabe von Informationen dargestellt haben. Darum befasst sich dieses Kapitel mit der anderen Seite, der Eingabe von Daten und Informationen in ein AR-System. Zuerst werfen wir einen Blick auf Arten und M\\u00f6glichkeiten der Eingabe, um uns danach mit der Interaktion mit AR-Systemen zu befassen. Auch dieses Kapitel beschlie\\u00dfen wir mit einer \\u00dcbung. Wir werden unser eigenes System so erweitern, dass wir nicht nur Objekte im Raum bewegen, sondern auch mit ihnen interagieren k\\u00f6nnen.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Das vorhergehende Kapitel kann derart aufgefasst werden, dass wir bald in einer augmentierten Welt leben werden und jederzeit von weiteren Informationen und zus\\u00e4tzlichen 3-D-Objekten umgeben sind. Man neigt dazu, das Bild der Holobench aus Star Trek in die Realit\\u00e4t zu \\u00fcbertragen. Virtuelle Objekte schmiegen sich perfekt in die Realit\\u00e4t ein und sind nicht mehr von anderen zu unterscheiden. Die Zukunft ist nicht vorherzusehen, aber in den kommenden Jahren werden virtuelle Objekte noch als solche erkennbar sein. Sie werden nicht genau platziert sein, werden hier und da im Bild springen und nicht die plastische Tiefe von echten Gegenst\\u00e4nden haben. Wie bei der VR sind die Erwartungen sehr hoch gesteckt und mit den in Augenblick zu Verf\\u00fcgung stehenden Mitteln nicht erreichbar. Es mag zu erwarten sein, dass die Kosten f\\u00fcr qualitativ hochwertige Ausr\\u00fcstung und der zeitliche Aufwand, um ein AR-System in Betrieb zu nehmen, in den kommenden Jahren sinken. Die Leistung von Grafikkarten und Prozessoren scheint in immer neue Dimensionen vorzusto\\u00dfen und AR Frameworks werden langsam erwachsen.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Im Produktionsbereich bilden Montaget\\u00e4tigkeiten am Ende der Produktionskette einen sehr wichtigen Bestandteil der Wertsch\\u00f6pfungskette. Landau et al. (2001) schreiben von \\u00fcber einer Million Montagearbeitspl\\u00e4tzen in der Fahrzeug- und Elektroindustrie sowie im Maschinen und Anlagenbau. Auch die manuelle Montage ist in vielen Bereichen der Industrie weit verbreitet, sie stellt einen wesentlichen Bestandteil der Produktions- und Servicebereiche der in diesem Sektor arbeitenden Unternehmen dar. Mit dem Aufkommen von Augmented Reality (AR) als neuer Form der Mensch-Rechner-Interaktion er\\u00f6ffnen sich Potentiale zur Unterst\\u00fctzung an Montagearbeitspl\\u00e4tzen, die sich auch auf die Arbeitsorganisation auswirken. Gegenstand dieses Kapitels ist die Untersuchung von AR-Systemen unter m\\u00f6glichst realistischen Bedingungen an realen Montagearbeitspl\\u00e4tzen. Im Gegensatz zu den bei Wiedenmaier (2004) beschrieben quantitativen Untersuchungen zur Einsetzbarkeit von AR-Technologien in der manuellen Montage und der quantitativen Evaluation von verbesserten Darstellungsm\\u00f6glichkeiten von virtuellen Objekten gehen die hier gew\\u00e4hlten Beispiele auf einem qualitativen Niveau einen Schritt weiter. In den beiden Montageszenarien werden alle Arbeitst\\u00e4tigkeiten und damit die gesamten Arbeitspl\\u00e4tze neu gestaltet und mit den zuk\\u00fcnftigen Arbeitspersonen qualitativ evaluiert. Ein weiterer interessanter Ansatz ist der einer Produktion vorgelagerte Bereich der kooperativen Anlagenplanung. Dabei k\\u00f6nnen Kooperationspartner aus verschiedenen, r\\u00e4umlich verteilten Unternehmensteilen oder einzelnen Unternehmen eine Produktionsanlage planen. Der Evaluationsfokus liegt im Bereich der Wirtschaftlichkeit eines Einsatzes von AR-Netcollaboration. Im Gegensatz zu den beiden Montageszenarien, bei denen aufgrund der permanenten Arbeit mit den AR-Systemen das Usability Engineering im Mittelpunkt steht, wird hier vor allem die Zeit- und Kostenersparnis in den Vordergrund gestellt. Dennoch darf auf bei der kooperativen Anlagenplanung die Benutzbarkeit nicht au\\u00dfer Acht gelassen werden.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Recent technology advances in both Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are creating an opportunity for a paradigm shift in the design of human-computer interaction systems. Delving into the Reality-Virtuality Continuum, we find Mixed Reality \\u2013 systems designed to augment the physical world with virtual entities that embody characteristics of real world objects. In the medical field, Mixed Reality systems can overlay real-time and spatially accurate results onto a patient\\u2019s body without the need for external screens. The complexity of these systems previously required specialized prototypes, but newly available commercial products like the Microsoft HoloLens make the technology more available. Through a combination of literature review, expert analysis, and prototyping we explore the use of Mixed Reality in this setting. From the experience of prototyping HoloSim and Patiently, two applications for augmenting medical training and education, we outline considerations for the future design and development of virtual interfaces grounded in reality.\",\n",

In this paper we present Tiles, a MR authoring interface for easy and effective spatial composition, layout and arrangement of digital objects in MR environments. Based on a tangible MR interface approach, Tiles is a transparent user interface that allows users to seamlessly interact with both virtual and physical objects. It also introduces a consistent MR interface model, providing a set of tools that allows users to dynamically add, remove, copy, duplicate and annotate virtual objects anywhere in the 3D physical workspace. Although our interaction techniques are broadly applicable, we ground them in an application for rapid prototyping and evaluation of aircraft instrument panels. We also present informal user observations and a preliminary framework for further work.\",\n",

Delving into the Reality-Virtuality Continuum, we find Mixed Reality - systems designed to augment the physical world with virtual entities that embody characteristics of real world objects. In the medical field, Mixed Reality systems can overlay real-time and spatially accurate results onto a patient's body without the need for external screens. The complexity of these systems previously required specialized prototypes, but newly available commercial products like the Microsoft HoloLens make the technology more available. Through a combination of literature review, expert analysis, and prototyping we explore the use of Mixed Reality in healthcare. From the experience of prototyping Patiently and HoloSim, two applications for augmenting medical training, we outline considerations for the future design and development of virtual interfaces grounded in reality.\",\n",

We understand mixed reality games as goal-directed, structured play experiences that are not fully contained by virtual or physical worlds. They transform existing technologies, relationships, and places into platforms for gameplay. While the design of mixed reality games has received increasing attention across multiple disciplines, a focus on the collaborative potential of mixed reality formats, such as augmented and alternate reality games, has been lacking. We believe the CSCW community can play an essential and unique role in examining and designing the next generation of mixed reality games and technologies that support them. To this end, we seek to bring together researchers, designers, and players to advance an integrated mixed reality games' research canon and outline key opportunities and challenges for future research and development.\",\n",

The aim of the system is to create Mixed Reality (MR) applications simply by plugging together small prefabricated software components, instead of compiling monolithic C++ applications. The flexibility and the advantages of the presented framework are explained on the basis of an exemplary implementation of a classic Augmented Realityapplication and its extension to a collaborative remote expert scenario.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Mixed reality computer systems aim to fuse digital and physical information and features, either as an augmentation of real-world environments or as a means of providing physically-based interaction with computer-based systems. So - for example - museum displays can be augmented with added information about their history and provenance, and this information delivered to a visitor via their mobile telephone as they pass in front of the display. An increasing number of systems are exploiting mixed reality but to date there are no systematic methods, techniques or guidelines for the development of such systems. In bringing together contributions on a broad range of mixed reality development issues this book provides a sound theoretical foundation for a disciplined approach to mixed reality engineering. Divided into three parts, interaction design, software design and implementation, this book brings together state of the art developments in the engineering of mixed reality systems, addressing issues at these three levels. Part 1 covers generic and specific mixed reality design elements and provides an overview of the design method; Part 2 addresses technical solutions for interaction techniques, development tools and a global view of the mixed reality software development process. Finally part 3 contains detailed case studies to highlight the application of mixed reality in a variety of fields including aviation, architecture, emergency management, games, and healthcare. Multimodal and tangible interaction designers, systems engineers working in augmented reality and ubiquitous systems, human factors researchers, and others interested in the use of mixed reality techniques in their work, will find this book a useful addition to their bookshelf.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Aerial photographs play a major role in current remote sens- ing applications. Traditionally such photographs were ac- quired using airplanes or satellites, and later processed in order to generate a virtual environment (VE). The industrial research project AVIGLE explores novel approaches to multimodal remote sensing by using a swarm of Miniature Un- manned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs), which are equipped with different sensing and network technologies. The acquired data will be sent in quasi-real time to a ground control sta- tion, where a VE will be generated automatically. Although this approach introduces a new low-cost alternative to the traditional remote sensing processes, it opens up numerous research and engineering challenges. In this position paper we introduce a mixed reality (MR)-based simulation framework, which has been developed in the scope of the AVIGLE project. The main idea for this framework is to create a con- trolled environment in which parts of the system are real, whereas other parts are virtual and can be simulated for testing purposes. This MR simulation framework is intended to use virtual and real sensing technology in combination to provide a flexible solution to simulate and evaluate different hardware setups and algorithms.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In previous work, researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that robots' use of deictic gestures enables effective and natural human-robot interaction. However, new technologies such as augmented reality head mounted displays enable environments in which mixed-reality becomes possible, and in such environments, physical gestures become but one category among many different types of mixed reality deictic gestures. In this paper, we present the first experimental exploration of the effectiveness of mixed reality deictic gestures beyond physical gestures. Specifically, we investigate human perception of videos simulating the display of allocentric gestures, in which robots circle their targets in users' fields of view. Our results suggest that this is an effective communication strategy, both in terms of objective accuracy and subjective perception, especially when paired with complex natural language references.\",\n",

An experience was developed\\r\\nwhich involved a paper-based \\u2018history hunt\\u2019 around a castle searching for clues about historical events\\r\\nthat happened at the site. The clues involved people making drawings or rubbings on paper at a variety of\\r\\nlocations. The paper was then electronically tagged and used to interact with a story tent. This consisted\\r\\nof a tarpaulin structure with projections on either side. A Radio Frequency ID tag reader and ultra violet\\r\\nlight were positioned inside the tent. When placed on the tag reader, each paper clue revealed an historic\\r\\n3D environment of the castle from the location at which the clue was found. \\u2018Secret writing\\u2019 revealed the\\r\\nstory of a character at this location, while 2D images on the tent displayed corresponding scenes from this\\r\\nhistorical period. Visitors to the castle over 4 days took part in this experience.

Even when step by step instructions are available, most bystanders do not attempt resuscitation due to panic or fear of failing, often at the cost of the victim's life. We propose Mixed Reality (MR) as a compelling medium to support time-critical emergencies, and study its use in this context through an iterative user-centered design process. Our research outlines a number of key considerations for the design of time-critical emergency interfaces that led to the creation of HoloCPR, an MR application providing real-time instructions for resuscitation through a combination of visual and spatial cues. HoloCPR's comparative evaluation during a realistic resuscitation scenario indicates how the use of MR can result in decreased reaction time and increased procedural accuracy. With this work, we hope to bootstrap a new wave of MR applications for time-critical emergencies that can be included in first aid kits in the future.\",\n",

The high amount of data collected with LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data for realistic rendering and simulation problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to be transformed into representations that fulfill the computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In this tutorial participants will be introduced to state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing and surface reconstruction with open source software to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by interleaved presentations, software demonstrations and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in C/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes and other meshing methods will play another central role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering, segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface reconstruction will be provided. Participants are invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical problems occuring when working with large scale 3D point clouds in VR and AR applications.\",\n",

This research contributes ways in which mixed reality game UIs can focus players on the physical environment, leveraging its unique affordances.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This chapter presents an overview of the Mixed Reality (MR) paradigm, which proposes to overlay our real-world environment with digital, computer-generated objects. It presents example applications and outlines limitations and solutions for their technical implementation. In MR systems, users perceive both the physical environment around them and digital elements presented through, for example, the use of semitransparent displays. By its very nature, MR is a highly interdisciplinary field engaging signal processing, computer vision, computer graphics, user interfaces, human factors, wearable computing, mobile computing, information visualization, and the design of displays and sensors. This chapter presents potential MR applications, technical challenges in realizing MR systems, as well as issues related to usability and collaboration in MR. It separately presents a section offering a selection of MR projects which have either been partly or fully undertaken at Swiss universities and rounds off with a section on current challenges and trends.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The augmentation of real environments with additional computer generated information (augmented reality, AR), and the addition of virtual contents (mixed reality, MR) are promising interaction paradigms for the support of applications outside the classical office scenario. While the potential of AR for applications such as geo-visualization has been shown using a number of demonstration systems, there are virtually no systems in daily use up to now. This is mainly due to technical reasons. Besides suitable displays, there is a lack of reliable and accurate tracking systems, which are however required for an exact registration of the virtual contents and the real scene. Additionally, there is a lack of experience and tools for the creation of mixed reality applications and often, of intuitive interaction techniques. Especially for applications involving public audience (e.g. exhibitions, museums, public participation), additional requirements apply, such as reliability, robustness, easy adaptation to different users, and the necessity for relatively low operating expenses. In this paper, we introduce the GeoScope, a mixed-reality input/output device, which addresses those problems, especially for public applications. The GeoScope is mounted at a fixed position and consists of a display, oriented towards the user, and a camera, which points at the surroundings. Just as a telescope, the GeoScope can be turned around two axes, the two angles being captured by measuring devices. Together with the known position, a fast and highly precise tracking of the current view direction is possible, allowing the superposition of the real scene, as delivered by the camera, and virtually generated information.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Mixed Reality (MR) applications along Milgram's Reality-Virtuality (RV) continuum motivated a number of recent theories on potential constructs and factors describing MR experiences. This paper investigates the impact of incongruencies on the sensation/perception and cognition layers to provoke breaks in plausibility, and the effects these breaks have on spatial and overall presence as prominent constructs of Virtual Reality (VR). We developed a simulated maintenance application to test virtual electrical devices. Participants performed test operations on these devices in a counterbalanced, randomized 2x2 between-subject design in either VR as congruent, or Augmented Reality (AR) as incongruent on the sensation/perception layer. Cognitive incongruency was induced by the absence of traceable power outages, decoupling perceived cause and effect after activating potentially defective devices. Our results indicate significant differences in the plausibility ratings between the VR and AR conditions, hence between congruent/incongruent conditions on the sensation/perception layer. In addition, spatial presence revealed a comparable interaction pattern with the VR vs AR conditions. Both factors decreased for the AR condition (incongruent sensation/perception) compared to VR (congruent sensation/perception) for the congruent cognitive case but increased for the incongruent cognitive case. The results are discussed and put into perspective in the scope of recent theories of MR experiences.\",\n",

The benefit of our approach is that it adds physical forces while keeping the users' hands free to interact unencumbered-not only with virtual objects, but also with physical objects, such as props and appliances. We demonstrate how this supports three classes of applications along the mixed-reality continuum: (1) entirely virtual objects, such as furniture with EMS friction when pushed or an EMS-based catapult game. (2) Virtual objects augmented via passive props with EMS-constraints, such as a light control panel made tangible by means of a physical cup or a balance-the-marble game with an actuated tray. (3) Augmented appliances with virtual behaviors, such as a physical thermostat dial with EMS-detents or an escape-room that repurposes lamps as levers with detents. We present a user-study in which participants rated the EMS-feedback as significantly more realistic than a no-EMS baseline.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper presents an image-based rendering approach to accelerate rendering time of virtual scenes containing a large number of complex high poly count objects. Our approach replaces complex objects by impostors, light-weight image-based representations leveraging geometry and shading related processing costs. In contrast to their classical implementation, our impostors are specifically designed to work in Virtual-, Augmented- and Mixed Reality scenarios (XR for short), as they support stereoscopic rendering to provide correct depth perception. Motion parallax of typical head movements is compensated by using a ray marched parallax correction step. Our approach provides a dynamic run-time recreation of impostors as necessary for larger changes in view position. The dynamic run-time recreation is decoupled from the actual rendering process. Hence, its associated processing cost is therefore distributed over multiple frames. This avoids any unwanted frame drops or latency spikes even for impostors of objects with complex geometry and many polygons. In addition to the significant performance benefit, our impostors compare favorably against the original mesh representation, as geometric and textural temporal aliasing artifacts are heavily suppressed.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper presents an image-based rendering approach to accelerate rendering time of virtual scenes containing a large number of complex high poly count objects. Our approach replaces complex objects by impostors, light-weight image-based representations leveraging geometry and shading related processing costs. In contrast to their classical implementation, our impostors are specifically designed to work in Virtual-, Augmented- and Mixed Reality scenarios (XR for short), as they support stereoscopic rendering to provide correct depth perception. Motion parallax of typical head movements is compensated by using a ray marched parallax correction step. Our approach provides a dynamic run-time recreation of impostors as necessary for larger changes in view position. The dynamic run-time recreation is decoupled from the actual rendering process. Hence, its associated processing cost is therefore distributed over multiple frames. This avoids any unwanted frame drops or latency spikes even for impostors of objects with complex geometry and many polygons. In addition to the significant performance benefit, our impostors compare favorably against the original mesh representation, as geometric and textural temporal aliasing artifacts are heavily suppressed.\",\n",

      "    \"title\": \"Facilitating Mixed Reality Public Participation for Modern Construction Projects: Guiding Project Planners with a Configurator\",\n",
      "    \"abstract\": \"Digital public participation formats are an emerging and accessible way to involve diverse groups of citizens in construction projects in their local area. Particularly, mixed reality can help project initiators to visualize the planned changes to the city landscape in an easy and understandable way, enabling people to participate in a creative manner. However, this technology is challenging for most project initiators, as it requires an extensive technical and/or domain experience. Besides that, specialized hardware and experienced staff is required. An easy on-boarding process, which introduces mixed reality step-by-step and offers assistance by external service providers could promote both adoption and usage. In this paper, we present the design process and resulting concept of a configurator for a public participation platform, that aims to guide initiators with different levels of technical knowledge. Besides detailing the design and development process of the prototype, we will present the preliminary results of our evaluation. The interview partners provided positive feedback on the usage of our configurator. Moreover, different approaches are necessary for the public and private sector when configuring and purchasing their participation solution. Finally, we highlight areas that are still in need of further work, such as the compliance with the regulations for public institutions and address further promising areas of research.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This thesis studies eye-based user interfaces which integrate information about the user\\u2019s perceptual focus-of-attention into multimodal systems to enrich the interaction with the surrounding environment. We examine two new modalities: gaze input and output in the peripheral field of view. All modalities are considered in the whole spectrum of the mixed-reality continuum. We show the added value of these new forms of multimodal interaction in two important application domains: Automotive User Interfaces and Human-Robot Collaboration. We present experiments that analyze gaze under various conditions and help to design a 3D model for peripheral vision. Furthermore, this work presents several new algorithms for eye-based interaction, like deictic reference in mobile scenarios, for non-intrusive user identification, or exploiting the peripheral field view for advanced multimodal presentations. These algorithms have been integrated into a number of software tools for eye-based interaction, which are used to implement 15 use cases for intelligent environment applications. These use cases cover a wide spectrum of applications, from spatial interactions with a rapidly changing environment from within a moving vehicle, to mixed-reality interaction between teams of human and robots.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"With the advent of ubiquitous and pervasive computing environments, one of promising applications is a guidance system. In this paper, we propose a mobile mixed reality guide system for indoor environments, Chloe@University. A mobile computing device (Sony's Ultra Mobile PC) is hidden inside a jacket and a user selects a destination inside a building through voice commands. A 3D virtual assistant then appears in the see-through HMD and guides him/her to destination. Thus, the user simply follows the virtual guide. Chloe@University also suggests the most suitable virtual character (e.g. human guide, dog, cat, etc.) based on user preferences and profiles. Depending on user profiles, different security levels and authorizations for content are previewed. Concerning indoor location tracking, WiFi, RFID, and sensor-based methods are integrated in this system to have maximum flexibility. Moreover smart and transparent wireless connectivity provides the user terminal with fast and seamless transition among Access Points (APs). Different AR navigation approaches have been studied: Olwal 2006, Elmqvist et al. and Newman et al. work indoors while Bell et al. 2002 and Reitmayr and Drummond 2006 are employed outdoors. Accurate tracking and registration is still an open issue and recently it has mostly been tackled by no single method, but mostly through aggregation of tracking and localization methods, mostly based on handheld AR. A truly wearable, HMD based mobile AR navigation aid for both indoors and outdoors with rich 3D content remains an open issue and a very active field of multi-discipline research.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"From analyzing complex socio-technical systems, to evaluating novel interactions, increasingly pervasive sensing technologies provide researchers with new ways to observe the world. This paradigm shift is enabling capture of richer and more diverse data, combining elements from in-depth study of activity and behavior with modern sensors, and providing the means to accelerate sense-making of complex behavioral data. At the same time novel multimodal signal processing and machine learning techniques are equipping us with 'super powers' that enable understanding of these data in real-time, opening up new opportunities for embracing the concept of 'Data Science in the Wild'. In this paper we present what this transition means in the context of Health and Healthcare, focusing on how it leads to the 'UbiScope', a ubiquitous computing microscope for detecting particular health conditions in real-time, promoting reflection on care, and guiding medical practices. Just as the microscope supported key scientific advances, the UbiScope will act as a proxy for understanding and supporting human activity and inform specific interventions in the years ahead.\",\n",

The location of the overt visual attention of the user can be used both to disambiguate referent objects and to inform an intelligent view management of the user interface. While the vertical and horizontal orientation of attention is quite commonly used, e.g. derived from the orientation of the head, only knowledge about the distance allows for an intrinsic measurement of the location of the attention. This contribution reviews our latest results on detecting the location of attention in 3D space using binocular eye tracking.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The rapid development of 3D scanning technology combined\\n                  with state-of-the-art mapping algorithms allows to\\n                  capture 3D point clouds with high resolution and\\n                  accuracy. The high amount of data collected with\\n                  LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM\\n                  approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data\\n                  for realistic rendering and simulation\\n                  problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to\\n                  be transformed into representations that fulfill the\\n                  computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In\\n                  this tutorial participants will be introduced to\\n                  state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing\\n                  and surface reconstruction with open source software\\n                  to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by\\n                  interleaved presentations, software demonstrations\\n                  and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point\\n                  cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d\\n                  trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in\\n                  C/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes\\n                  and other meshing methods will play another central\\n                  role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point\\n                  cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering,\\n                  segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface\\n                  reconstruction will be provided. Participants are\\n                  invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows\\n                  laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical\\n                  problems occuring when working with large scale 3D\\n                  point clouds in VR and AR applications.\",\n",

In this article we present how the autonomous control of the virtual characters and the interpretation of user interactions is realized in the Conversational Dialogue Engine (CDE) framework. For each virtual and real interlocutor one CDE is responsible for dialogue processing. We will introduce the knowledge needed for the CDE-approach and present the modules of a CDE. The real-time requirement resulted in the integrated processing of deliberative and reactive processing, which is needed, e.g., to generate an appropriate nonverbal behavior of virtual characters.\",\n",

In this article we present how the autonomous control of the virtual characters and the interpretation of user interactions is realized in the Conversational Dialogue Engine (CDE) framework. For each virtual and real interlocutor one CDE is responsible for dialogue processing. We will introduce the knowledge needed for the CDE-approach and present the modules of a CDE. The real-time requirement resulted in the integrated processing of deliberative and reactive processing, which is needed, e.g., to generate an appropriate nonverbal behavior of virtual characters.\",\n",
