Makerspaces are, simply put, places where people gather to make things. Although that may sound like a simplistic definition, the things that can be created in a makerspace vary a great deal. Makerspaces can be high tech, low tech, and everything in between. A makerspace's offerings revolve around the needs of the community it serves, but the one thing all have in common is that they bring people together to share ideas. Typically, the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about mak- erspaces is 3D printing, but when it comes to what\u2019s going on in makerspaces around the world, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Makers create things, ideas, and concepts. Makers work in metal, wood, plastic, fabric, paper, and digital forms. From robotics to crocheting, there are no limits to your makerspace. Let your imagination run wild. In this chapter, we\u2019ll provide the information and ideas to get your maker-spaces up and running based on your unique populations and budgets. You\u2019ll find a myriad of ways to create your makerspace. You\u2019ll also discover ways to ensure your makerspace is fun and functional.","tags":["greenbib"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"ALA Editions","isbn":"9780838915042","url":""},{"search_string":"makerspace","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2fb48ac2947255e4aca45f9dcc913a382\/ereidt","author":["Kevin M.

Linguistic analysis as a data mining technique holds promise for revealing different dimensions of learning exhibited by students in makerspaces. In this study, student reflections on makerspace projects were gathered in 2 formats over 2 years: private written assessments captured in the 3D GameLab gamification platform, and semi-public video-recorded assessments posted in the more social FlipGrid platform. Transcripts of student assessments were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) to generate 4 summary variables thought to inform makerspace outcomes of interest (i.e. analytical thinking, authenticity, clout, and emotional tone). Comparative findings indicate that written assessments may elicit more analytical thinking about maker projects compared with less analytical conversation in videos, while video assessments may elicit somewhat higher clout scores as evidence of social scaffolding along with a much more positive emotional tone. Recommendations are provided for layering assessment approaches to maximize the potential benefits of each format, including reflective writing for social spaces, in social groups, and about design processes and procedures.","tags":["assessment","outcomes","makerspace","learninganalytics","linguisticanalysis"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10763-020-10060-2"},{"search_string":"makerspace","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2789d019603b437609dec3272a28f24a9\/bibgreen","author":null,"text":"The makerspace librarian's sourcebook","year":"2017","abstract":"The Makerspace Librarian's Sourcebook is an essential all-in-one guidebook to the maker realm written specifically for librarians.

Four objectives guided the study: what constituted makerspace in academic library, the level of awareness of makerspace by academic library benefits and challenges of adopting makerspace in libraries. The descriptive survey design was adopted and questionnaire was used for data collection. The population of the study comprised of professional and paraprofessional librarians of Ambrose University and University of Benin, from which a sample size of 119 was drawn using total enumeration sampling technique. Out of the 119 copies of questionnaire administered, 94 were retrieved and analyzed using simple percentage and frequency tables. Findings revealed that, the respondents were aware of what constitute makerspace which are library space, 3D printers, computers and projector. It was also discovered that, the respondents had a high level of awareness of makerspace in the library. Some of the benefits associated with the use of makerspace are: it facilitates group interaction, it improves knowledge and provides access to wide varieties of tools and technology. Some of the challenges encountered in the adoption of makerspace are training of academic library staff, security of makerspace gadgets, poor funding, erratic power supply, high cost and maintenance of equipment. It was however recommended that; librarians should make deliberate effort to explore the potentials in makerspace in the enhancement of their services and training should be conducted regularly to enhance librarian\u2019s skills in the use of ICTs Kingsley Efe OSAWARU, Angela Ishioma DIME and Emordi Herbert OKONJO 2020.

This original research study ask two key questions: How is learning achieved and supported in makerspaces? What can academic library services bring to the effective organisation and support of makerspaces? Design\/methodology\/approach An extensive literature review is followed by a template analysis (King, 2012) of data from an online forum of three professionals operating makerspaces in academic library services in the USA and a discussion incorporating relevant educational theory and philosophy. Findings The three overarching learning themes found were: experiential learning (Dewey, 1909; Kolb, 1984), communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991) and self-efficacy through social learning (Bandura, 1997). Research limitations\/implications The one-week forum of three professional library staff provided detailed and informative data. Substantial field work with students will also be required to see how far this professional lens has provided insight into how students are learning and supported in these and other makerspaces. Social implications The wider cultural implications are examined, including the potential social value of makerspaces as transformative creative spaces empowering communities and individuals. Originality\/value This is the first study to date on the potential educational value of makerspaces within HE, and the specific support academic library services can offer if they choose to host a makerspace (including teaching information, digital and critical literacies).","tags":["greenbib"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"makerspace","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27b26f179035fcf52b69dc9547218b33e\/bibgreen","author":["Donatas Kubilius","Vaida Gasi\u016bnait\u0117"],"text":"Every good adaptation is also an innovation: Poster presented at IFLA WLIC 2019, Athens, Greece","year":"2019","abstract":"Every good adaptation is also an innovation poster represents Makerspace PATS SAU in National library of Lithuania.

This new expanded service will serve our users in different ways: one Makerspace will focus further on digital skills by offering drone building classes, 3D printing and robotics; the second one will focus on more manual competences like sewing, stitching and hand-lettering but also embrace technology by offering a low-level introduction to photo and film making. The MakerBus will combine the best of both Makerspaces, offering modules in 3D printing, programming, sewing, and on top a small mobile workshop for fixing bikes and small electrical items, encouraging responsible consumption and less waste.

It is argued that current trends in society like DIY, sharing or the maker movement have huge influence on the discussion of public library services in the digital age. They also provide the groundwork for makerspaces and community building as one of the main parts of future library services. This development is combined with the urban gardening trend. One main aspect of this thesis is the understanding, that urban gardening is an essential part of the digital age and not its counterpart. Urban gardening has lots of characteristics of the DIY and maker movement. Regarding urban gardening and community gardens as makerspaces gives the basis to combine them with library services. Urban gardening makerspaces are embedded in the ideas of the green library and the sustainable library. Therefore, this thesis proposes a definition for ecological and societal sustainable library services. Afterwards the potentials of urban gardening and public libraries and their role in urban development are highlighted. A guideline for public libraries for creating their own urban gardening makerspaces completes this thesis.","tags":["greenbib"],"pub-type":"phdthesis","publisher":"Institut f\u00fcr Informationswissenschaft","isbn":null,"url":"\/brokenurl#urn:nbn:de:hbz:79pbc-opus-9923"},{"search_string":"makerspace","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27f14dda9a045ecfee948569189b75a43\/dblp","author":["Sang-Yeal Han","Jaeheung Yoo","Hangjung Zo","Andrew P.

Public libraries hence need to demonstrate relevance to their communities, sponsors and other accountable bodies to avoid the continuance of this trend. This paper shows how libraries can link into debates in society and politics by adopting the urban gardening trend as well as developing new services around this green movement. Within the debate on public libraries\u2019 transformation, urban gardening and the idea of the green library provide an opportunity to develop new green and sustainable library services. By combining makerspaces and community building with urban gardening and foodsharing, the public library of Bad Oldesloe developed a series of events that turned the library into a modern and creative learning space.

In fact, tighter budgets and the complex demands of both library users and staff call for careful preparation now more than ever. Whether you're building from the ground up or simply remodeling, the success of your project hinges on planning, coordination, and communication. This new update of Sannwald's classic guide will help you stay prepared and organized for every phase of your undertaking from conception through the dedication ceremony. Using a popular checklist format that ensures no detail is overlooked, this planner covers crucial considerations like Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) factors, structured to match the federal code; sustainable design features, including sensors that save energy and water; designing makerspaces, digital media labs, or leased library enterprises; disaster and recovery planning; creating quiet spaces; collaborative collections and materials-handling efficiency; and important virtual presence aspects to bear in mind during physical space decisions. Library managers, administrators, and facilities staff will find this book a matchless tool for any construction project regardless of size or complexity.","tags":["greenbib"],"pub-type":"book","publisher":"ALA Editions an imprint of the American Library Association","isbn":"9780838913710","url":""},{"search_string":"makerspace","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/216f291f3d87c9d71806d82d6897b32be\/dblp","author":["Jennifer Wyld"],"text":"MakerSpaces as Figured Worlds.","year":"2017","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"9781450363495","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/fablearn\/fablearn2017.html#Wyld17"},{"search_string":"makerspace","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27dd0b54df0308ec55ed0acbecf8f1c31\/dblp","author":["Cristina G.

Eine empirische Befragung offener Werkst\u00e4tten in Deutschland","year":"2016","abstract":"Zusammenfassung Es wird wieder gebastelt, geschraubt, gel\u00f6tet, repariert. Werkst\u00e4tten erleben heutzutage eine unerwartete Renaissance. Der Sammelbegriff \u201eoffene Werkst\u00e4tten\u201c umfasst verschiedene Formen von Infrastrukturen zur gemeinsamen Nutzung von Mitteln f\u00fcr materielle Produktion und den offenen Austausch dar\u00fcber. Konkret handelt es sich um gemeinwohlorientierte Repair Caf\u00e9s, Siebdruckwerkst\u00e4tten und Fahrradreparaturinitiativen, aber auch um gewerblich orientierte FabLabs und Hackerspaces. Die gewachsene Bedeutung und die gestiegene Zahl der offenen Werkst\u00e4tten sind Ausdruck und Ergebnis sich ver\u00e4ndernder Produktions- und Innovationsbedingungen in der Wirtschaft. Dezentralisierungsprozesse der stofflichen Produktion, die durch die technisch avancierten Auspr\u00e4gungen offener Werkst\u00e4tten vorangetrieben werden, k\u00f6nnen sich auch transformativ auf andere Branchen auswirken. Entsprechend dieser Dynamiken wurden offene Werkst\u00e4tten als vielschichtige Orte untersucht, um sowohl Nachhaltigkeits- als auch Innovationspotenziale in den Blick zu nehmen. Im Sommer 2015 richteten wir eine Befragung an 453 offene Werkst\u00e4tten in Deutschland, um deren Innovations- und Arbeitsprozesse genauer in den Blick zu nehmen. Auf der Basis eines Datensamples von 103 Antworts\u00e4tzen (R\u00fccklaufquote 23 %) rekonstruiert die vorliegende Studie die sozialen, materiellen und \u00f6konomischen Wirkungsprozesse in diesen Werkst\u00e4tten. Die starke Dynamik des Ph\u00e4nomens zeigt sich unter anderem daran, dass die meisten Antwortenden der offenen Werkstatt zwischen 2013 und 2015 beigetreten sind. \u00dcber die H\u00e4lfte hat ihre Werkstatt selbst mitbegr\u00fcndet. Der \u00fcberwiegende Teil besitzt eine naturwissenschaftliche Qualifikation. Gemeinschaftsorientierung \u2013 nicht das materielle Endergebnis oder die Herstellung eines Gegenstandes \u2013 ist der Hauptgrund f\u00fcr das Engagement in offenen Werkst\u00e4tten. Die pers\u00f6nliche Motivation der Aktiven liegt weniger im \u00f6konomischen Bereich als vielmehr in der Vermittlung von Wissen, dem praktischen Arbeiten und in einer gesellschaftlichen Transformation. Das Erproben neuer sozialer Wege des Lernens, der Wissensvermittlung und des Zusammenarbeitens stehen im Mittelpunkt allt\u00e4glicher Praktiken in offenen Werkst\u00e4tten. Summary Lately, there is a noticeable trend that people start doing handicrafts again. And thus open workshops experience an unexpected renaissance. The term \u201copen workshops\u201d comprises different kinds of infrastructures for the shared use of resources for material production and an open exchange about it. This includes non-commercial repair caf\u00e9s, screen printing workshops and initiatives for bicycle repair as well as commercially oriented fab labs and hackerspaces. The growing number and importance of open workshops are the result of changing economic conditions for production and innovation. The decentralization of physical production, which is promoted by the technically advanced types of open workshops, may also have transformative effects on other sectors. Multiple aspects of open workshops were investigated to assess the potentials of these dynamics for sustainability and innovation. To investigate the work and innovation activivties, 453 open workshops in Germany were addressed by an empirical survey in the summer 2015. Based on a data sample of 103 observations (which corresponds to a response rate of 23 %), the social, material and economic processes within open workshops have been reconstructed. The strong dynamics of this phenomenon is demonstrated by the fact that the majority of the respondents joined the open workshops between 2013 and 2015. More than half of them are cofounders of the workshop. Predominantly, respondents have an educational background in natural sciences. Community-orientation \u2013 not the material end result or the fabrication of an object \u2013 is the principal reason for engaging in open workshops. The personal motivations of the actors are not primarily economic, but rather directed towards the transfer of knowledge, practical working experiences and societal transformation. Experimentation with new social forms of learning, knowledge transfer and collaboration is central to the everyday practice in open workshops.","tags":["Open_Workshops","Transformative_Learning","Offene_Werkstaetten","Transformatives_Lernen","Maker_Space","Fab_Lab"],"pub-type":"electronic","publisher":"Institut f\u00fcr \u00f6kologische Wirtschaftsforschung (I\u00d6W) Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe 105 D-10785 Berlin Tel. +49 \u2013 30 \u2013 884 594-0 Fax +49 \u2013 30 \u2013 882 54 39 E-mail: mailbox@ioew.de www.ioew.de","isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.ioew.de\/fileadmin\/user_upload\/BILDER_und_Downloaddateien\/Publikationen\/Schriftenreihen\/IOEW_SR-213_Wertschoepfung_in_offenen_Werkstaetten.pdf"},{"search_string":"makerspace","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/25d91687c48459b8db828664dcbbd3a6d\/antje","author":["Sandra Sch\u00f6n","Martin Ebner","Kristin Narr"],"text":"Making-Aktivit\u00e4ten mit Kindern und Jugendlichen.

Their key success factors were found to include the abilities to leverage core capabilities and to overcome institutional deficiencies through relationship building.

The call comes from both government and private corporate circles, and it also emanates from enthusiasts for free and open source software (FOSS), i.e. software that anyone is free to use, copy, study, and change in any way. Ironically, rate of participation in FOSS-related work is far lower than in other areas of computing. A 2002 European Union study showed that fewer than 2 percent of software developers in the FOSS world were women. How is it that an intellectual community of activists so open in principle to one and all -a community that prides itself for its enlightened politics and its commitment to social change - should have such a low rate of participation by women?

There has been a subtle yet significant change in the way human beings interface with their computing devices. The traditional standard of keyboard and mouse is not the only way we have to communicate with our computers anymore. We have entered the age of the personal digital assistant, which can deliver results with nothing but a voice command. Some of the largest technology companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon) believe that the digital agent will eventually be the primary interface we use to communicate with our computerized gadgets, the internet, and our network of interconnected devices (Internet of Things). With that belief in mind, these companies are attempting to make their version of a digital agent the de facto standard for most consumers. Each company is looking to establish a foothold in this marketspace because they believe digital agent technology is the key that will hold consumers in their respective digital ecosystems. In other words, once you use a particular digital agent and establish a connection with the software, it will be difficult to switch to a different digital agent. Essentially, if you were to change, you would have to start all over again.","tags":["learn","paper","language","speech","ai","processing","assist","zzz.sds","recognition","analysis","01624","generation"],"pub-type":"techreport","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.techrepublic.com\/resource-library\/whitepapers\/personal-digital-assistants-the-current-lineup\/"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/23fd8543b39255b7c5b5ee981822b1563\/stevenarild","author":["S J O'Leary","M A Hutchins","D R Stevenson","C Gunn","A Krumpholz","G Kennedy","M Tykocinski","M Dahm","B Pyman"],"text":"Validation of a networked virtual reality simulation of temporal bone surgery","year":"2008","abstract":"To assess the content validity and concurrent validity of a haptically (force feedback) rendered, virtual reality simulation of temporal bone surgery.Eleven naive surgical trainees were given a 1-hour lesson on the operation, cortical mastoidectomy, in the virtual environment with the trainer on a networked simulator and then asked to perform this procedure on a real temporal bone.The simulator was found to be a convincing representation of temporal bone drilling and could be said to exhibit face validity.

The virtual reality concept is familiar to us from online worlds, but our world as a virtual reality is usually a subject for science fiction rather than science. Yet logically the world could be an information simulation running on a multi-dimensional space-time screen. Indeed, if the essence of the universe is information, matter, charge, energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the many conservation laws could be a single law of information conservation. If the universe were a virtual reality, its creation at the big bang would no longer be paradoxical, as every virtual system must be booted up. It is suggested that whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual reality is a matter for science to resolve. Modern information science can suggest how core physical properties like space, time, light, matter and movement could derive from information processing. Such an approach could reconcile relativity and quantum theories, with the former being how information processing creates space-time, and the latter how it creates energy and matter.","tags":["world","virtual","reality","philosophy","physical","digital"],"pub-type":"misc","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/0801.0337"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2fcb9d250115ed23e0cf7027d7e725a5d\/ijtsrd","author":["Pratibha Jha | Sapna Yadav"],"text":"Virtual and Augmented Reality An Overview","year":"2019","abstract":"Augmented reality is an innovation which allows a user to the computer simulated environment, regardless of whether that condition is a reproduction of this present reality or a conjured up universe.

There were 12 experts, six residents, and nine novices. After orientation, participants were asked to perform a modified radical mastoidectomy on the simulator. Comparisons of time taken, injury to structures, and forces exerted were made between the groups to determine which specific metrics would discriminate experience levels.Experts completed the simulated task in significantly shorter time than the other two groups (experts 22 minutes, residents 36 minutes, and novices 46 minutes; P = 0.001). Novices exerted significantly higher average forces when dissecting close to vital structures compared with experts (0.24 Newton N vs 0.13 N, P = 0.002). Novices were also more likely to injure structures such as dura compared to experts (23 injuries vs 3 injuries, P = 0.001). Compared with residents, the experts modulated their force between initial cortex dissection and dissection close to vital structures. Using the combination of these metrics, we were able to correctly classify the participants' level of experience 90 percent of the time.This preliminary study shows that measurements of performance obtained from within a virtual reality simulator can differentiate between levels of users' experience.

Using automated, computer-controlled systems, it is possible to generate virtual stimuli or even entire environments that can be modified to test hypotheses on bee visual behaviour. The bee itself can remain tethered in place, making it possible to record neural activity while the bees is performing behavioural tasks. Recent studies have examined visual navigation and attentional processes in VR on flying or walking tethered bees, but experimental paradigms for examining visual learning and memory are only just emerging. Behavioural performances of bees under current experimental conditions are often lower in VR than in natural environments, but further improvements on current experimental protocols seem possible.

We also included trials comparing different methods of virtual reality training.We collected the data on the characteristics of the trial, methodological quality of the trials, mortality, morbidity, conversion rate, operating time, and hospital stay. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis.We included 23 trials with 612 participants. Four trials compared virtual reality versus video trainer training. Twelve trials compared virtual reality versus no training or standard laparoscopic training. Four trials compared virtual reality, video trainer training and no training, or standard laparoscopic training. Three trials compared different methods of virtual reality training. Most of the trials were of high risk of bias. In trainees without prior surgical experience, virtual reality training decreased the time taken to complete a task, increased accuracy, and decreased errors compared with no training; virtual reality group was more accurate than video trainer training group. In the participants with limited laparoscopic experience, virtual reality training reduces operating time and error better than standard in the laparoscopic training group; composite operative performance score was better in the virtual reality group than in the video trainer group.Virtual reality training can supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training of apprenticeship and is at least as effective as video trainer training in supplementing standard laparoscopic training.

Furthermore, studies are needed in which VRET is not just a component of the treatment package evaluated, but in which VRET should be assessed as a stand-alone treatment.","tags":["reference","physology","vr"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2db051d6e2d95ae779ad54e47a863499e\/niebling","author":["Jan-Philipp Stauffert","Florian Niebling","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"Towards Comparable Evaluation Methods and Measures for Timing Behaviour of Virtual Reality Systems","year":"2016","abstract":"A low latency is a fundamental timeliness requirement to reduce the potential risks of cyber sickness and to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and user experience of Virtual Reality Systems.

Studies addressed three general areas: pain management, eating disorders, and cognitive and motor rehabilitation. Studies were small and heterogeneous and utilized different designs and measures. Virtual reality was generally well tolerated by patients, and a majority of studies demonstrated clinical efficacy. Studies varied in quality, as measured by an evaluation metric developed by Reisch, Tyson, and Mize (average quality score=0.87; range=0.78-0.96). Conclusion: Virtual reality is a promising intervention with several potential applications in the inpatient medical setting.

We are interested in creating pedagogical narratives: narratives encompass affective phenomena and rather than organizing events changing the course of a training scenario, pedagogical plans using our system focus on organizing the affects it arouses for the trainees. Efficiently controlling a virtual audience towards a specific training objective while evaluating the speaker's performance presents a challenge for a seminar instructor: the high level of cognitive and physical demands required to be able to control the virtual audience, whilst evaluating speaker's performance, adjusting and allowing it to quickly react to the user\u2019s behaviors and interactions. It is indeed a critical limitation of a number of existing systems that they rely on a Wizard of Oz approach, where the tutor drives the audience in reaction to the user\u2019s performance. We address this problem by integrating with a VAS a high-level control component for tutors, which allows using predefined audience behavior rules, defining custom ones, as well as intervening during run-time for finer control of the unfolding of the pedagogical plan. At its core, this component offers a tool to program, select, modify and monitor interactive training narratives using a high-level representation. The STAGE offers the following features: i) a high-level API to program pedagogical narratives focusing on a specific public speaking situation and training objectives, ii) an interactive visualization interface iii) computation and visualization of user metrics, iv) a semi-autonomous virtual audience composed of virtual spectators with automatic reactions to the speaker and surrounding spectators while following the pedagogical plan V) and the possibility for the instructor to embody a virtual spectator to ask questions or guide the speaker from within the Virtual Environment. We present here the design, implementation of the tutoring system and its integration in STAGE, and discuss its reception by end-users.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/frvir.2022.876433\/abstract"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2b2794f19f4e3676696d9f743f8c59006\/mcm","author":["Gerd Bruder","Frank Steinicke","Phil Wieland"],"text":"Self-motion illusions in immersive virtual reality environments","year":"2011","abstract":"Motion perception in immersive virtual reality environments significantly differs from the real world. For example, previous work has shown that users tend to underestimate travel distances in immersive virtual environments (VEs). As a solution to this problem, some researchers propose to scale the mapped virtual camera motion relative to the tracked real-world movement of a user until real and virtual motion appear to match. In such a way, real-world movements could be mapped with a larger gain to the VE in order to compensate for the underestimation. Although this approach usually results in more accurate self-motion judgments by users, introducing discrepancies between real and virtual motion can become a problem, in particular, due to misalignments of both worlds and distorted space cognition. In this paper we describe a different approach that introduces apparent self-motion illusions by manipulating optic flow fields during movements in VEs. These manipulations can affect self-motion perception in VEs, but omit a quantitative discrepancy between real and virtual motions. We introduce four illusions and show in experiments that optic flow manipulation can significantly affect users\u2019 self-motion judgments. Furthermore, we show that with such manipulation of optic flow fields the underestimation of travel distances can be compensated.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/06110000\/user_upload\/Paper\/IMG\/2011\/VR11.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2baf6f707dbc3435980c1fc0efe7966f4\/stevenarild","author":["H W Francis","M U Malik","D A Diaz Voss Varela","M A Barffour","W W Chien","J P Carey","J K Niparko","N I Bhatti"],"text":"Technical skills improve after practice on virtual-reality temporal bone simulator","year":"2012","abstract":"To assess whether practice on a virtual-reality (VR) temporal bone simulator improves acquisition of technical skills in mastoid surgery.Prospective blinded study.Using a previously validated objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) tool, performance was assessed in 12 residents for two tasks of cortical mastoidectomy: 1) identifying and defining the tegmen and 2) defining the sigmoid sinus and sinodural angle.

The first objective was to implement real-time soft-tissue deformation and cutting into a virtual reality myringotomy simulator. The second objective was to test the various implemented incision algorithms to determine which most accurately represents the tympanic membrane during myringotomy.Descriptive and face-validity testing.A deformable tympanic membrane was developed, and three soft-tissue cutting algorithms were successfully implemented into the virtual reality myringotomy simulator. The algorithms included element removal, direction prediction, and Delaunay cutting. The simulator was stable and capable of running in real time on inexpensive hardware. A face-validity study was then carried out using a validated questionnaire given to eight otolaryngologists and four senior otolaryngology residents. Each participant was given an adaptation period on the simulator, was blinded to the algorithm being used, and was presented the three algorithms in a randomized order.A virtual reality myringotomy simulator with real-time soft-tissue deformation and cutting was successfully developed. The simulator was stable, ran in real time on inexpensive hardware, and incorporated haptic feedback and stereoscopic vision. The Delaunay cutting algorithm was found to be the most realistic algorithm representing the incision during myringotomy (P < .05). The Likert and visual analog scales had strong correlations, suggesting good internal reliability.The first virtual reality myringotomy simulator is being developed and now integrates a real-time deformable tympanic membrane that appears to have face validity.

Traditionally those photographs were acquired using airplanes or satellites, and later manually processed in order to generate a virtual environment. Recently, Miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs) equipped with digital cameras have been proposed as inexpensive and more flexible alternative to acquire aerial images. The industrial research project Avionic Digital Service Platform (AVIGLE) explores novel approaches to remote sensing by using a swarm of MUAVs, which are equipped with different sensing and network technologies. The acquired data will be sent in quasi-real time to a flight ground control station, where a virtual environment will be generated automatically. While this approach has the potential to provide an efficient alternative to the traditional remote sensing processes, it opens up numerous research and engineering challenges. In this paper we describe a virtual reality-based simulation framework, which has been developed in the scope of the AVIGLE project. Since the project involves a lot of risks, the simulation of the entire system in a VR-based environment is essential to create a controlled virtual environment that is independent of hardware, flight permissions and influences like weather and lighting conditions. During the project the use of VR is not limited to presentation purposes, but also serves as testbed to simulate and evaluate different hardware setups and software algorithms.","tags":["objects","virtual","stadtmodellen","virtualreality","interactive"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/viscg.uni-muenster.de\/publications\/2010\/SSFRHVDM10"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2f159e82261d548cb47c9d54218134751\/cmcneile","author":["Philip Blanco","Gur Windmiller","William Welsh","Sean Hauze"],"text":"Lessons Learned from Teaching Astronomy with Virtual Reality","year":"2019","abstract":"We report on the initial phase of an ongoing, multi-stage investigation of how to incorporate Virtual Reality (VR) technology in teaching introductory astronomy concepts.

The task involved identification and delineation of the sigmoid sinus in a virtual left-sided temporal bone.Objective data were produced using a scoring matrix incorporated into the VOXEL MAN TempoSurg software. The simulator measured the total time taken to complete the task, the volume and efficiency of bone removal and error data for excessive force or injury to the facial nerve, dura, and sigmoid sinus.Experts and intermediates outperformed novices with respect to the total time taken to complete the task (expert versus novice: p < 0.001; intermediate versus novice: p < 0.001), total volume of bone removed (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03), efficiency of bone removal (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001), time spent with the drill tip obscured (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001), and number of injuries to the sigmoid sinus (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The intermediate group injured the sigmoid sinus on more occasions than the experts (p = 0.008) and were less efficient than experienced surgeons (p = 0.005).Simulator-generated objective metrics can be used to differentiate individuals of differing levels of experience using a standardized temporal bone task. VR simulation has potential as a training tool and may have a role in both formative and summative assessment.","tags":["voxelman","t-vr-sim"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ep.fjernadgang.kb.dk\/pubmed\/?term=Objective+Skills+Assessment+and+Construct+Validation+of+a+Virtual+Reality+Temporal+Bone+Simulator"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21754223b5091ed3a6f068d96859146de\/gaitat","author":["Georgios Papaioannou","Athanasios Gaitatzes","Dimitrios Christopoulos"],"text":"Enhancing virtual reality walkthroughs of archaeological sites","year":"2003","abstract":"This paper describes the methodological aspects of the application of various established and new graphics techniques in virtual reality applications, in order to visually enrich conventional walkthroughs and extend the common capabilities of virtual environment visualization platforms.

All virtual content, including 3D models and 2D desktop windows, is attached to tracked physical objects in order to leverage the efficiencies of natural two-handed manipulation. The presence of 2D desktop space within 3D facilitates data exchange between the two realms, enables control of 3D information by 2D applications, and generally increases productivity by providing access to familiar tools.

When developing VR applications, developers should be able to focus on modeling advanced interaction and system behavior instead of rendering issues. Many systems and tools for developing virtual reality applications have been proposed to achieve this goal. However, no de facto standard is available. In this paper we present Virtual Reality VRS (VR2S), a generic VR software system, which is an extension of the high-level rendering system VRS. The system provides flexibility in terms of the rendering system and the user interface toolkit. Thus, with using VR2S\u00c2 rendering can be performed with several low-level rendering APIs such as OpenGL, RenderMan or ray-tracing systems, and the interface can be implemented by arbitrary user interface toolkits to support both desktop- and VR-based interaction. The proposed system meets the demands of VR developers as well as users and has demonstrated its potential in different planning and exploration applications.","tags":["objects","stadtmodellen","virtualreality","interactive"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.mcm.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/06110000\/user_upload\/Paper\/IMG\/2005\/SRH05c.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2e4e65c55d0016275b24262c0163031b6\/dblp","author":["Brian M.

After the training, trainees were asked to perform a cortical mastoidectomy on a cadaveric temporal bone. The dissection was videotaped and assessed by 3 otologists blinded to participants' teaching group.The overall performance scores of the simulator-based training group were significantly higher than those of the traditional training group (67% vs 29%; P < .001), with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93, indicating excellent interrater reliability.

We hypothesized that both computerized analysis and expert ratings would discriminate the performance of novices from experienced trainees. We also hypothesized that performance on the virtual reality temporal bone simulator (VR TB) would differentiate based on previous drilling experience.The authors conducted a randomized, blind assessment study.Nineteen volunteers from the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery training program at the University of Toronto drilled both a cadaveric TB and a simulated VR TB. Expert reviewers were asked to assess operative readiness of the trainee based on a blind video review of their performance. Computerized hand motion analysis of each participant's performance was conducted.Expert raters were able to discriminate novices from experienced trainees (P < .05) on cadaveric temporal bones, and there was a trend toward discrimination on VR TB performance. Hand motion analysis showed that experienced trainees had better movement economy than novices (P < .05) on the VR TB.Performance, as measured by hand motion analysis on the VR TB simulator, reflects trainees' previous drilling experience. This study suggests that otolaryngology trainees could accomplish initial temporal bone training on a VR TB simulator, which can provide feedback to the trainee, and may reduce the need for constant faculty supervision and evaluation.","tags":["voxelman","t-vr-sim"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ep.fjernadgang.kb.dk\/pubmed\/17204992"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/216c1d085bbe945b02274a6e71038cc2d\/dblp","author":["Woodrow Barfield"],"text":"The right of publicity in virtual reality.","year":"2007","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/vr\/vr11.html#Barfield07"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21f514cbfad17fd898de002375aa0f21e\/dblp","author":["Cristian Luciano","Pat P.

While some legal and ethical concerns about the potential identity issues of the digital bodies have been raised, and despite some progress in specific areas such as user authentication has been made, little research has proposed practical solutions. Finally, we suggest potential future research directions for digital body protection and include relevant research that might provide insights. We hope this work could provide a good overview of the existing discussion, potential solutions, and future directions for researchers with similar concerns. We also wish to draw attention to identity and privacy issues in social VR and call for interdisciplinary collaboration.","tags":["myown","prima","emlab"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/frvir.2022.974652"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2371e6023cd028c08d54791cf0706e2ef\/hci-uwb","author":["Andreas Halbig","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"A Systematic Review of Physiological Measurements, Factors, Methods, and Applications in Virtual Reality","year":"2021","abstract":"Measurements of physiological parameters provide an objective, often non-intrusive, and (at least semi-)automatic evaluation and utilization of user behavior. In addition, specific hardware devices of Virtual Reality (VR) often ship with built-in sensors, i.e. eye-tracking and movements sensors. Hence, the combination of physiological measurements and VR applications seems promising. Several approaches have investigated the applicability and benefits of this combination for various fields of applications. However, the range of possible application fields, coupled with potentially useful and beneficial physiological parameters, types of sensor, target variables and factors, and analysis approaches and techniques is manifold. This article provides a systematic overview and an extensive state-of-the-art review of the usage of physiological measurements in VR. We identified 1,119 works that make use of physiological measurements in VR. Within these, we identified 32 approaches that focus on the classification of characteristics of experience, common in VR applications. The first part of this review categorizes the 1,119 works by field of application, i.e. therapy, training, entertainment, and communication and interaction, as well as by the specific target factors and variables measured by the physiological parameters. An additional category summarizes general VR approaches applicable to all specific fields of application since they target typical VR qualities. In the second part of this review, we analyze the target factors and variables regarding the respective methods used for an automatic analysis and, potentially, classification. For example, we highlight which measurement setups have been proven to be sensitive enough to distinguish different levels of arousal, valence, anxiety, stress, or cognitive workload in the virtual realm. This work may prove useful for all researchers wanting to use physiological data in VR and who want to have a good overview of prior approaches taken, their benefits and potential drawbacks.","tags":["myown","hci-uwb","via-vr"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2021-frotniers-review-physiological-measurements.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2e60aedf738252f4f3aabd381d5bc9e61\/dblp","author":["Kevin Ponto","Joe Kohlmann","Ross Tredinnick"],"text":"DSCVR: designing a commodity hybrid virtual reality system.","year":"2015","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/vr\/vr19.html#PontoKT15"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/234865675b76f672613494481504bd686\/dblp","author":["Patrick Neumann","Dirk Siebert","Armin Schulz","Gabriele Faulkner","Manfred Krauss","Thomas Tolxdorff"],"text":"Using virtual reality techniques in maxillofacial surgery planning.","year":"1999","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/vr\/vr4.html#NeumannSSFKT99"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/280a27816806d5922ad96d4867cf752ea\/dblp","author":["Abhishek Seth","Judy M.

To tackle this challenging issue, we conducted an experiment wherein participants learned an immersive virtual environment using a joystick. The following day, participants' brain activity was monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging while they mentally estimated distances in this environment. Results were compared with that of participants performing the same task but having learned the real version of the environment by actual walking. We detected a large set of areas shared by both groups including the parieto-frontal areas and the parahippocampal gyrus. More importantly, although participants of both groups performed the same mental task and exhibited similar behavioral performances, they differed at the brain activity level. Unlike real learners, virtual learners activated a left-lateralized network associated with tool manipulation and action semantics. This demonstrated that a neural fingerprint distinguishing virtual from real learning persists when subjects use a mental representation of the learnt environment with equivalent performances.","tags":["mapping","virtual","reality","cognition","games","spatial","neurosome","fmri","neuropsychology","brain"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":"Wiley-Liss","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www3.interscience.wiley.com\/journal\/123201417\/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/207919c33f8364ebae37508dfde8d4379\/mts.group","author":["Nina D\u00f6llinger","Erik Wolf","David Mal","Stephan Wenninger","Mario Botsch","Marc Erich Latoschik","Carolin Wienrich"],"text":"Resize Me!

Thirteen children aged 8--13 years comprised the study group. Children attended eight one-hour virtual reality play sessions in which they were immersed and interacted with virtual reality. The Test of Playfulness (TOP) was used as the measure to assess playfulness. Participants were videotaped while they played during 12 different environments over the course of their intervention time. Three randomly selected virtual reality play sessions were chosen to score three different virtual reality environments within each session yielding a total of nine trials (environments) for each participant. The types of virtual environments varied across participants. Overall, the different virtual reality play environments produced varying levels of playfulness according to the TOP's four different subscale scores. Motivation ranged from 1.50 to 2.25, internal control ranged from 1.00 to 1.88, suspension of reality ranged from 0 to 0.26, and framing ranged from 1.33 to 1.78. The three environments producing the highest playfulness ratings were called Paint, Trip and Island Sounds. These environments allowed creativity, persistence with the task, pleasure, and a certain degree of control. Two environments did not appear to foster playfulness. A possible reason was that these environments were too unpredictable and frustrating for participants. These results will be useful for creating new virtual reality software applications that will encourage playfulness in children with disabilities","tags":["print-red","children","virtual-reality","play","vr","pilot","cp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/207919c33f8364ebae37508dfde8d4379\/n.doellinger","author":["Nina D\u00f6llinger","Erik Wolf","David Mal","Stephan Wenninger","Mario Botsch","Marc Erich Latoschik","Carolin Wienrich"],"text":"Resize Me!

The paper first reviews key advantages of different eye tracking technologies as available for desktop, natural and virtual environments. It then explains how combining virtual reality settings with eye tracking provides a unique opportunity for shopper research in particular regarding the use of augmented reality to provide shopper assistance.","tags":["shopping","eye_tracking","virtual_reality"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0148296317303478"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22f4c83464c82950712a728283aa66443\/hci-uwb","author":["Erik Wolf","Nina D\u00f6llinger","David Mal","Stephan Wenninger","Andrea Bartl","Mario Botsch","Marc Erich Latoschik","Carolin Wienrich"],"text":"Does Distance Matter? Embodiment and Perception of Personalized Avatars in Relation to the Self-Observation Distance in Virtual Reality","year":"2022","abstract":"Virtual reality applications employing avatar embodiment typically use virtual mirrors to allow users to perceive their digital selves not only from a first-person perspective but also from a holistic third-person view. However, due to distance-related biases such as the distance compression effect or a reduced relative rendering resolution, the self-observation distance (SOD) between the user and the virtual mirror might influence how users perceive their embodied avatar. Our article systematically investigates the effects of a short (1 meter), middle (2.5 meter), and far (4 meter) SOD between user and mirror on the perception of personalized and self-embodied avatars. The avatars were photorealistic reconstructed using state-of-the-art photogrammetric methods. Thirty participants were repeatedly exposed to their real-time animated self-embodied avatars in each of the three SOD conditions. In each condition, the personalized avatars were repeatedly altered in their body weight, and participants were asked to judge the (1) sense of embodiment, (2) body weight perception, and (3) affective appraisal towards their avatar. We found that the different SODs are unlikely to influence any of our measures except for the perceived body weight estimation difficulty. Here, the participants judged the difficulty significantly higher for the farthest SOD. We further found that the participants' self-esteem significantly impacted their ability to modify their avatar's body weight to their current body weight and that it positively correlated with the perceived attractiveness of the avatar. Additionally, the participants' concerns about their body shape affected how eerie they perceived their avatars. Both measures influenced the perceived body weight estimation difficulty. For practical application, we conclude that the virtual mirror in embodiment scenarios can be freely placed and varied at a distance of one to four meters from the user without expecting major effects on the perception of the avatar.","tags":["ewolf","myown","emlab","vitras","dmal"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2022-frontiers-self-observation-distance.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/25e849ff27fc7e216f2a354c5e6b71faa\/yish","author":["Maria Roussou","Martin Oliver","Mel Slater"],"text":"The virtual playground: an educational virtual reality environment for evaluating interactivity and conceptual learning.","year":"2006","abstract":null,"tags":["environment","virtual","mathematics","reality","interactivity","playground","learning","VR","education","HCI"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/vr\/vr10.html#RoussouOS06"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d558489fcbf1cfbdcb5e617183374e55\/dblp","author":["Brenda K.

The principal factors responsible for this phenomenon have remained largely unknown. However, recent experiments suggest that when the virtual environment (VE) is an exact replica of a user's real physical surroundings, the person's distance perception improves. Furthermore, it has been shown that when users start their virtual reality (VR) experience in such a virtual replica and then gradually transition to a different VE, their sense of presence in the actual virtual world increases significantly. In this case the virtual replica serves as a transitional environment between the real and virtual world. In this paper we examine whether a person's distance estimation skills can be transferred from a transitional environment to a different VE. We have conducted blind walking experiments to analyze if starting the VR experience in a transitional environment can improve a person's ability to estimate distances in an immersive VR system. We found that users significantly improve their distance estimation skills when they enter the virtual world via a transitional environment.","tags":["objects","virtual","stadtmodellen","virtualreality","interactive"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM Press","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.mcm.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/06110000\/user_upload\/Paper\/IMG\/2009\/SBRHLI09.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/25e849ff27fc7e216f2a354c5e6b71faa\/dblp","author":["Maria Roussou","Martin Oliver","Mel Slater"],"text":"The virtual playground: an educational virtual reality environment for evaluating interactivity and conceptual learning.","year":"2006","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/vr\/vr10.html#RoussouOS06"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2ca903f93168e0b23e9510f2e6f229fac\/dblp","author":["Christina Vasilakis"],"text":"User Studies for Toolkit Development in Virtual Reality.","year":"1994","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Psychology of Programming Interest Group","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/ppig\/ppig1994.html#Vasilakis94"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d66ce8226d429c780d10cc9efae7af46\/c.wienrich","author":["Carolin Wienrich","Nina D\u00f6llinger","Rebecca Hein"],"text":"Behavioral Framework of Immersive Technologies (BehaveFIT): How and Why Virtual Reality can Support Behavioral Change Processes","year":"2021","abstract":null,"tags":["myown","journal_paper","full_paper","c.wienrich","vitras","coteach","change_experience"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389%2Ffrvir.2021.627194"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/29bc91d50087458abb3466a75e009cde6\/dblp","author":["Denis V.

The increasing development of VR technologies has matured enough to expand research from the military and scientific visualization realm into more multidisciplinary ar-eas, such as education, art and entertainment. Consequently, virtual reality interfaces interaction techniques and devices have improved greatly in order to provide more natural and obvious modes of interaction and motivational elements.

We investigated the usability of the adaptive system in a simulated social virtual reality scenario. Participants completed an n-back task (primary) and a visual detection (secondary) task. Here, we adapted the visual complexity of the secondary task in the form of the number of not-playable characters of the secondary task to accomplish the primary task.

In particular multi-touch interaction has proven its usability for 2D tasks, but the challenges to exploit these technologies in virtual reality (VR) setups have rarely been studied. In this paper we address the challenge to allow users to interact with stereoscopically displayed virtual environments when the input is constrained to a 2D touch surface. During interaction with a large-scale touch display a user changes between three different states: (1) beyond the arm-reach distance from the surface, (2) at arm-reach distance and (3) interaction. We have analyzed the user\u2019s ability to discriminate stereoscopic display parallaxes while she moves through these states, i. e., if objects can be imperceptibly shifted onto the interactive surface and become accessible for natural touch interaction. Our results show that the detection thresholds for such manipulations are related to both user motion and stereoscopic parallax, and that users have problems to discriminate whether they touched an object or not, when tangible feedback is expected.","tags":["based","LOCUI","objects","touching","floating","projection"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Eurographics","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.mcm.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/06110000\/user_upload\/Paper\/IMG\/2010\/VSBHSDK10.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21533ab4fc374b9f5ff669c4b92e4aaad\/mansisharma","author":["Kumar Mridul","M.

In this paper we introduce so called interscopic interaction concepts providing an improved working experience, which enable great potentials in terms of the interaction between 2D elements, which may be displayed either in monoscopic or stereoscopic, e.g., GUI items, and the 3D virtual environment usually displayed stereoscopically. We present a framework which is based on a software layer between the operating system and its graphical user interface supporting the display of both mono- as well as stereoscopic content in arbitrary regions of an autostereoscopic display. The proposed concepts open up new vistas for the interaction in environments where essential parts of the GUI are displayed monoscopically and other parts are rendered stereoscopically.

Visualization is also essential in the data mining process, directing the choice of the applicable algorithms, and in helping to identify and remove bad data from the analysis. However, a high complexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical obstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may exist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can perceive and interact with multidimensional information poses some deep questions in the field of cognition technology and human-computer interaction. To this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms for scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity hardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi-dimensional data visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their data and their colleagues in the same visual space.

In order to improve a goalkeeper's training by allowing insights into their complex perception, learning and action processes, virtual reality (VR) technologies provide a way to standardize experimental sport situations. In this poster we describe a VR-based handball system, which supports the evaluation of perceptual-motor skills of handball goalkeepers during shots. In order to allow reliable analyses it is essential that goalkeepers can move naturally like they would do in a real game situation, which is often inhibited by wires or markers that are usually used in VR systems. To address this challenge, we developed a camera-based goalkeeper analysis system, which allows to detect and measure motions of goalkeepers in real-time.","tags":["LOCUI","virtual","goalkeeper","reality","handball","analysis"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.mcm.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/06110000\/user_upload\/Paper\/IMG\/2010\/BZBSHFS10.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2685af0e4192acb88b2df2686c666bcd7\/dblp","author":["Jacopo Aleotti","Stefano Caselli"],"text":"Grasp programming by demonstration in virtual reality with automatic environment reconstruction.","year":"2012","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/vr\/vr16.html#AleottiC12"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2825493ac4d5b49473905adcf66ad55eb\/dblp","author":["Polona Caserman","Augusto Garcia-Agundez","Robert Konrad","Stefan G\u00f6bel","Ralf Steinmetz"],"text":"Real-time body tracking in virtual reality using a Vive tracker.","year":"2019","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/vr\/vr23.html#CasermanGKGS19"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/228236695b9393d47e6e9a5d6c8d7fcf8\/dblp","author":["Josiane Bissonnette","Francis Dub\u00e9","Martin D.

Common solutions are based on specialised software and\/or hardware capable of rendering 3D content, which not only restricts accessibility to specific platforms but also increases the barrier for non expert users. Our approach addresses new audiences by making existing Virtual Environments (VEs) ubiquitously accessible. Its appeal is that a large variety of clients, like desktop PCs and handhelds, are ready to connect to VEs out of the box. We achieve this combining established videoconferencing protocol standards with a server based interaction handling. Currently interaction is based on natural speech, typed textual input and visual feedback, but extensions to support natural gestures are possible and planned.

These phenomena have been observed in both computer-generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper, we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic virtual reality (VR) systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for semiimmersive VR systems, i.e., a passive and active stereoscopic projection system as well as an immersive VR system, i.e., a head-mounted display, and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/06110000\/user_upload\/Paper\/IMG\/2011\/TVCGSI-2010-08-0183.R1_Steinicke.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2286122d6ef8a53b764e19067d4e634bd\/dblp","author":["Patrick Dickinson","Kathrin Gerling","Kieran Hicks","John C.

As such, the design and development of 3D spatial interaction devices are important in creating more realistic and immersive user experiences in 3D virtual environment applications through natural and intuitive human expression. In general, current commercially available 3D input devices for virtual reality applications like data gloves, multiple DOF sensors and trackers, etc. typically come with a heavy price tag. The objective of this research is to investigate an approach to setting up an inexpensive 6-DOF optical tracking system using Wii Remotes, which is adequate for 3D interaction in an interactive Head-Mounted Display (HMD) virtual reality system. For the purpose of HMD virtual reality, a user should ideally be able to use a 3D interaction device in a space surrounding the user. This cannot be achieved when using this game controller in the conventional manner. Also, normal usage of the controller only allows for relative positioning and cannot reliably track 6-DOF. This paper outlines a method of using Wii Remotes for 3D spatial interaction in an area surrounding the user. This paper also presents experimental results conducted in order to benchmark the accuracy of the system, by comparing the system\u2019s position and orientation estimates with the readings obtained from a commercial 6-DOF magnetic tracker.","tags":["virtual_reality","tracking","Wii_Remote"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/doi.searchdl.org\/01.IJNS.1.1.03"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2ebbd8dbb2f03dce36d520cbc9a0e682d\/davidmal","author":["Daniel Roth","Gary Bente","Peter Kullmann","David Mal","Christian Felix Purps","Kai Vogeley","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"Technologies for Social Augmentations in User-Embodied Virtual Reality","year":"2019","abstract":"Technologies for Virtual, Mixed, and Augmented Reality (VR, MR, and AR) allow to artificially augment social interactions and thus to go beyond what is possible in real life.

We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systems\u00e2\u20ac\u0090related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics. In previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This work\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 mshop provides a face\u00e2\u20ac\u0090to\u00e2\u20ac\u0090face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems RIS. Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as real\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepa\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current state\u00e2\u20ac\u0090of\u00e2\u20ac\u0090the\u00e2\u20ac\u0090art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sum\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 omarize the work our community is doing. Arranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop\\u0027s goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections: * Systems. Six development systems are presented InTml, Lightning, FlowVR, OpenMASK VISTA, and MORGAN * Abstraction Is \u00e2\u20ac\u0090 sues. Two papers address the issues of reusable VE platforms and alterna tives to scene graphs. * Special Issues.

We compared immersive virtual reality (VR), video see-through augmented reality (VST AR), and optical see-through AR (OST AR). The personalized virtual alter egos were generated by state-of-the-art photogrammetry methods. 42 participants were repeatedly exposed to animated versions of their 3D-reconstructed virtual alter egos in each of the three XR display conditions. The reconstructed virtual alter egos were additionally modified in body weight for each repetition. We show that the display types lead to different degrees of incongruence between the renderings of the virtual humans and the presentation of the respective environmental backgrounds, leading to significant effects of perceived mismatches as part of a plausibility measurement. The device-related effects were further partly confirmed by subjective misestimations of the modified body weight and the measured spatial presence. Here, the exceedingly incongruent OST AR condition leads to the significantly highest weight misestimations as well as to the lowest perceived spatial presence. However, similar effects could not be confirmed for the affective appraisal (i.e., humanness, eeriness, or attractiveness) of the virtual humans, giving rise to the assumption that these factors might be unrelated to each other.","tags":["ewolf","myown","emlab","vitras","dmal"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2022-ismar-avatar_plausibility_and_perception_display_study-preprint.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2a05cff37bd7e7c402762ef4a8599c9f8\/kw","author":["Blaine Bell","Steven Feiner","Tobias H\u00f6llerer"],"text":"View management for virtual and augmented reality","year":"2001","abstract":"We describe a view-management component for interactive 3D user interfaces.

Here, we utilize a widely available VR hardware platform (HTC Vive) and VR based freeform 3D visual arts software package (Google Tilt Brush), to digitize fault traces from photo-textured digital outcrop models of exposures of the Penrith Sandstone Formation (Lacy's Caves), in northwest England. Using MATLAB routines provided herein, triangular meshes output from Tilt Brush are used as the basis for 3D fracture trace map extraction, which in turn, are used to generate fracture properties (trace length, orientation, areal fracture intensity). We compare the results of this analysis to two equivalent datasets obtained from the Lacy's Caves model using digital outcrop analysis deployed via a conventional flat panel display: namely (1) a 3D trace map extracted using optical ray tracing from manually interpreted calibrated images and (2) 3D traces fitted directly the Lacy's Caves textured mesh using manual polyline interpretation within an established digital outcrop analysis software platform (OpenPlot). Fault statistics obtained using VR based analysis are broadly equivalent to those acquired from 3D trace maps extracted using the flat panel display deployed analyses presented herein. In this case study, it was found that VR based digital outcrop analysis provided faster data acquisition than the comparative pixel-based approach, which requires linkage and merging of traces mapped from multiple contiguous images. Manual raster analysis and optical ray tracing did however provide 3D trace maps with significantly higher areal fault intensity, with VR analysis incurring censoring of finer fault traces, due to the limited resolution of the outcrop model textured mesh. Whilst data acquisition times and resultant fault intensities proved similar between the VR and OpenPlot workflows, it was noted anecdotally, that the VR analysis holds some advantages for the operator when interpreting models exhibiting complex geometries, such as mine workings and caves systems, with the clip point implemented within the viewport of conventional digital outcrop analysis software tools obstructing the user from obtaining an optimum view of the outcrop surface. VR based digital outcrop analysis techniques, such as those presented here, provide an immersive analytical environment to the operator. This allows users to fuse powerful 3D visualizations of photo-realistic outcrop models with geological interpretation and data collection, fulfilling the early promise of \u2018virtual outcrops\u2019 as an analytical medium that can emulate traditional fieldwork. It is hoped that this study and its associated code library will facilitate the evaluation of emerging VR technologies for digital outcrop applications, by provided access to VR analytical tools for non-specialists in virtual reality systems. Finally, prospects for the use of VR technology within the field of digital outcrop geology, as well as within the wider geosciences, are also discussed.","tags":["geoscience","immersive","application","VR"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0098300421002892"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/215e484036b14fb5199a4b76f8c37ddda\/dblp","author":["Daniel Thalmann"],"text":"Using Virtual Reality Techniques in the Animation Process.","year":"1993","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"Elsevier","isbn":"9780122277481","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/books\/collections\/EGJ1993.html#Thalmann93"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d22f8a5d0b172f511ad900e254f51766\/dblp","author":["Ponsy R.

Conceptual design has not benefited from these sophisticated and highly precise software tools to the same degree because the creative activities associated with developing and communicating potential solutions with minimal details is far less formulaic in its implementation. At the early stages of product design the specifications and constraints have not been fully established. The industrial designers and engineers need the freedom to change and modify the product configuration and mechanical behavior to investigate a wide range of alternative solutions. Any CAD system that seeks to support and enhance conceptual design must, therefore, enable natural and haptic modes of human-computer interaction. Recent advancements in high- speed, multi-core computer hardware and virtual reality (VR) technology provide opportunities to link the more fluid processes of creative conceptual design with the rigidly defined tasks of product detailing and engineering analysis.

This direct interaction paradigm enables an intuitive method to apply actions by associating iconic representation of objects to each other. Since dragging of these iconic representations is the most time-consuming subtask of the drag-and-drop metaphor, many extensions of this approach have been proposed to enhance this process. However, a transfer of these concepts to virtual reality (VR) systems has not been realized. In this paper we propose the grab-and-throw metaphor which is a VR-based analogon to the drag-and-drop metaphor. The proposed concepts enable users to select a virtual object by grabbing it and to throw the object within a virtual environment (VE) in the direction of another object. As soon as the object hits another object, an associated action is performed. The trajectory of the thrown object is based on physical motions adapted from the real-world. In order to ease hitting a desired target object, snapping strategies are used such that the aimed object attracts the thrown object. 5A We give a technical description of the grab-and-throw metaphor and discuss example application scenarios which benefit from the usage of the described metaphor.","tags":["objects","virtual","stadtmodellen","virtualreality"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE Press","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.mcm.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/06110000\/user_upload\/Paper\/IMG\/2006\/SH06.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2567a44a1b251d86e78a786da39a4c5e4\/stevenarild","author":["Y C Zhao","G Kennedy","K Yukawa","B Pyman","S O'Leary"],"text":"Can virtual reality simulator be used as a training aid to improve cadaver temporal bone dissection?

METHOD: This is a pilot project using Second Life, an Internet-based virtual reality system, in which a virtual reality environment was constructed to simulate the auditory and visual hallucinations of two patients with schizophrenia. Eight hundred sixty-three self-referred users took a self-guided tour. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-nine (69%) of the users who toured the environment completed a survey. Of the survey responders, 440 (76%) thought the environment improved their understanding of auditory hallucinations, 69% thought it improved their understanding of visual hallucinations, and 82% said they would recommend the environment to a friend.

However, related research concerning technology integration in the classroom has shown that a valuable medium alone does not automatically lead to its successful use. It is therefore the aim of the paper to present an approach by which competencies of pre-service teachers for a successful and appropriate integration of Augmented and Virtual Reality-applications in the classroom are fostered - the own design of Augmented and Virtual Reality applications. We will begin with a short discussion of prominent findings and related work in regard to teaching and learning with and about Augmented and Virtual Reality in the first part before introducing the main goals and aspects of the presented pedagogical concept and the seminar in the second part of the paper. In the third part, two applications created in the seminar and qualitative data from an explorative study based on focus group interviews and participant observation will be presented.

Redgraph is capable of handling large data-sets, as we demonstrate on social network data from the U.S. Patent Trade Office. We develop a Semantic Web vocabulary of virtual reality terms compatible with GraphXML to map graph visualization into the Semantic Web itself. Our approach to visualizing Semantic Web data takes advantage of user-interaction in an immersive environment to bypass a number of difficult issues in 3-dimensional graph visualization layout by relying on users themselves to interactively extrude the nodes and links of a 2-dimensional graph into the third dimension. When users touch nodes in the virtual reality environment, they retrieve data formatted according to the data\u2019s schema or ontology. We applied Redgraph to social network data constructed from patents, inventors, and institutions from the United States Patent and Trademark Office in order to explore networks of innovation in computing. Using this data-set, results of a user study comparing extrusion (3-D) vs. no-extrusion (2-D) are presented. The study showed the use of a 3-D interface by subjects led to significant improvement on answering of fine-grained questions about the data-set, but no significant difference was found for broad questions about the overall structure of the data. Furthermore, inference can be used to improve the visualization, as demonstrated with a data-set of biotechnology patents and researchers.","tags":["iswc08"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-540-88564-1\\_38"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2fb54fb3fd374d2920714e6b8e2410eee\/kmd-ovgu","author":["Anne Rother","Myra Spiliopoulou"],"text":"Virtual Reality for Medical Annotation Tasks--A Systematic Review","year":"2022","abstract":null,"tags":["kmd"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":"Frontiers","isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/frvir.2022.717383"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27e8da3c0665e47f1e57a8f1eaaddc980\/dblp","author":["Junaidi Abdullah","Wan Noorshahida Mohd Isa","Mohd Ali Samsudin"],"text":"Virtual reality to improve group work skill and self-directed learning in problem-based learning narratives.","year":"2019","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/vr\/vr23.html#AbdullahIS19"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/24cb3f10628cee74ff0603f5938294977\/wiljami74","author":["Elinda Ai-Lim Lee","Kok Wai Wong","Chun Che Fung"],"text":"How Does Desktop Virtual Reality Enhance Learning Outcomes?

Various relevant constructs and their measurement factors were identified to examine how desktop VR enhances learning and the fit of the hypothesized model was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results supported the indirect effect of VR features to the learning outcomes, which was mediated by the interaction experience and the learning experience. Learning experience which was individually measured by the psychological factors, that is, presence, motivation, cognitive benefits, control and active learning, and reflective thinking took central stage in affecting the learning outcomes in the desktop VR-based learning environment. The moderating effect of student characteristics such as spatial ability and learning style was also examined. The results show instructional designers and VR software developers how to improve the learning effectiveness and further strengthen their desktop VR-based learning implementation. Through this research, an initial theoretical model of the determinants of learning effectiveness in a desktop VR-based learning environment is contributed.","tags":["technology-based"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/28c08869434b93f7c5909e084fb8c0d53\/oberdoerfer","author":["Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","Domna Banakou","Ayush Bhargava"],"text":"Editorial: The Light and Dark Sides of Virtual Reality","year":"2023","abstract":null,"tags":["myown","dark-sides-vr"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/frvir.2023.1200156\/full"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2ba6c99b9bf7a0c4a83f739fd1dbbbf04\/dblp","author":["George Mallen"],"text":"Back to the Cave - Cultural Perspectives on Virtual Reality.","year":"1993","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"Elsevier","isbn":"9780122277481","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/books\/collections\/EGJ1993.html#Mallen93"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/248ccd936820562b133cdce6e1c1c8c00\/dblp","author":["Oliver J.

SSR is meant to serve as a foundation for serious games. In this paper, we describe the concept of SSR alongside the implementation of a prototype in our smart lab. We designed multiple virtual environments with a varying degree of mismatch compared to the real world, and added selected objects to induce additional haptic and thermal stimuli to increase immersion. In two user studies we investigate their impact on spatial presence and intrinsic motivation which are especially important for serious games. Results suggest that spatial presence is maintained with higher mismatch, and increased by inducing additional stimuli.

As a proof of concept, we exemplify the proposed model in a virtual reality application which incorporates a head-mounted display with integrated eye tracking functionality. In this context, we implement several proactive system behaviors including contextual information presentation with an adaptive level of detail and attention guidance; the latter is implemented by detecting visual acuity limitations or attention drifts.","tags":["zzz.mmi","ai","graphics","acm","analysis","01801","multimodal","interface","dfki","3d","paper","user","algorithm"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"9781450344623","url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27721f07f06c935fec4d8d66eb832a0fd\/sia-bib","author":["Benjamin Eckstein","Eva Krapp","Anne Els\u00e4sser","Birgit Lugrin"],"text":"Smart substitutional reality: Integrating the smart home into virtual reality","year":"2019","abstract":"Recent advances in VR technology allow users to consume immersive content within their own living room.

Tracking technologies and stereoscopic visualization of three-dimensional structures allow a better insight into complex datasets. Unfortunately, these systems often lack intuitive interaction concepts and therefore reduce VRGIS to advanced visualization environments, since manipulation of the content is not or only rudimentarily possible. In this paper, we present a geographic information system for urban planning tasks in semi-immersive virtual reality (VR) systems. The objective of this approach is to provide professional city planners with an enhanced VR interface, which enables comfortable interaction concepts similar to the interactions of the real-world planning task. To assure the usability and relevance of the developed system, urban planners have cooperated closely in the development process. In this paper both the hard- and software architecture of the entire system as well as VR related interaction metaphors and their evaluation are discussed.","tags":["planning","city","immersive","urban","semi"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.mcm.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/06110000\/user_upload\/Paper\/IMG\/2006\/SRHM06.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20c64d27f7b03affd89db22092241885f\/hci-uwb","author":["Maximilian Landeck","Fabian Unruh","Jean-Luc Lugrin","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"Time Perception Research in Virtual Reality: Lessons Learned","year":"2023","abstract":"In this article, we present a selection of recent studies from our research group that investigated the relationship between time perception and virtual reality (VR). We focus on the influence of avatar embodiment, visual fidelity, motion perception, and body representation. We summarize findings on the impact of these factors on time perception, discuss lessons learned, and implications for future applications. In a waiting room experiment, the passage of time in VR with an avatar was perceived significantly faster than without an avatar. The passage of time in the real waiting room was not perceived as significantly different from the waiting room in VR with or without an avatar. In an interactive scenario, the absence of a virtual avatar resulted in a significantly slower perceived passage of time compared to the partial and full-body avatar conditions. High and medium embodiment conditions are assumed to be more plausible and to less different from a real experience. A virtual tunnel that induced the illusion of self-motion (vection) appeared to contribute to the perceived passage of time and experience of time. This effect was shown to increase with tunnel speed and the number of tunnel segments. A framework was proposed for the use of virtual zeitgebers along three dimensions (speed, density, synchronicity) to systematically control the experience of time. The body itself, as well as external objects, seem to be addressed by this theory of virtual zeitgebers. Finally, the standardization of the methodology and future research considerations are discussed.","tags":["vtimes","myown","landeck"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Ver\u00f6ffentlicht durch die Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Informatik e.V. in P.

Thirteen children aged 8-13 years comprised the study group. Children attended eight one-hour virtual reality play sessions in which they were immersed and interacted with virtual reality. The Test of Playfulness (TOP) was used as the measure to assess playfulness. Participants were videotaped while they played during 12 different environments over the course of their intervention time. Three randomly selected virtual reality play sessions were chosen to score three different virtual reality environments within each session yielding a total of nine trials (environments) for each participant. The types of virtual environments varied across participants. Overall, the different virtual reality play environments produced varying levels of playfulness according to the TOP's four different subscale scores. Motivation ranged from 1.50 to 2.25, internal control ranged from 1.00 to 1.88, suspension of reality ranged from 0 to 0.26, and framing ranged from 1.33 to 1.78. The three environments producing the highest playfulness ratings were called Paint, Trip and Island Sounds. These environments allowed creativity, persistence with the task, pleasure, and a certain degree of control. Two environments did not appear to foster playfulness. A possible reason was that these environments were too unpredictable and frustrating for participants. These results will be useful for creating new virtual reality software applications that will encourage playfulness in children with disabilities.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Cerebral","Male;","Therapy;","Pilot","User-Computer","Palsy;","Playthings;","Female;","Play","and","Projects;","Interface"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21b119525ecdcd11753bbef47bda6b963\/marcerich","author":["Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"A Gesture Processing Framework for Multimodal Interaction in Virtual Reality","year":"2001","abstract":"This article presents a gesture detection and analysis framework for modelling multimodal interactions.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the fundamental distinctions between AR and VR in the context of course instruction. Educators can acquire insights into how these technologies might be effectively integrated into the classroom by evaluating their specific traits, affordances, and limits. The research begins by defining AR and VR and then compares their key ideas. AR superimposes digital information on the real-world environment to improve the user's impression of reality, whereas VR immerses users in a simulated environment to create a sensation of presence and immersion. These contrasts lay the groundwork for comprehending their disparate uses in education. The study then goes into the educational benefits and difficulties of AR and VR. AR allows students to interact with digital information in real time, encouraging engagement, collaboration, and contextualized learning. It could bridge the gap between abstract ideas and real-world applications. VR, on the other hand, provides an immersive and regulated environment that allows students to explore complicated scenarios, imitate real-world circumstances, and acquire important skills in a safe and cost-effective manner. The research looks at the technology needs, accessibility concerns, and implementation techniques for AR and VR in educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of pedagogical design, content creation, and teacher training to maximize these technologies' educational impact. This review paper investigates the differences between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in the context of course education. AR and VR have emerged as significant tools for boosting the learning experience as technology continues to alter education. Understanding the distinct characteristics and benefits of each technology is critical for educators to make educated judgments about how to include them in their teaching practices.

The mechanisms and success of behavior change techniques and interventions are broadly investigated in the field of psychology. However, it is not always easy to adapt these psychological findings to the context of immersive technologies. The lack of theoretical foundation also leads to a lack of explanation as to why and how immersive interventions support behavior change processes. The Behavioral Framework for immersive Technologies (BehaveFIT) addresses this lack by 1) presenting an intelligible categorization and condensation of psychological barriers and immersive features, by 2) suggesting a mapping that shows why and how immersive technologies can help to overcome barriers and finally by 3) proposing a generic prediction path that enables a structured, theory-based approach to the development and evaluation of immersive interventions. These three steps explain how BehaveFIT can be used, and include guiding questions for each step. Further, two use cases illustrate the usage of BehaveFIT. Thus, the present paper contributes to guidance for immersive intervention design and evaluation, showing that immersive interventions support behavior change processes and explain and predict 'why' and 'how' immersive interventions can bridge the intention-behavior-gap.","tags":["myown","rhein","rebecca.hein"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/frvir.2021.627194\/full"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/28aaf30af3bc9b24ce6b0a8bf02a495ff\/pmem","author":["Pedro Monteiro","Diana Carvalho","Miguel Melo","Frederico Branco","Maximino Bessa"],"text":"Application of the steering law to virtual reality walking navigation interfaces.","year":"2018","abstract":"Navigation through immersive virtual environments is a key concept for virtual reality as it allows users to explore those environments.

The experiments consisted of having participants complete a series of paths with different indexes of difficulty and the time that a participant took to walk each path was measured.

The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.","tags":["augmented_reality","visualization"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s40537-015-0031-2"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/288994de1ba748ebc5e930ffb38ba02be\/mcm","author":["Antonio Kr\u00fcger","Johannes Sch\u00f6ning","Markus L\u00f6chtefeld","Frank Steinicke","Michael Rohs"],"text":"About Two Physical Interaction Metaphors: Narrowing the Gap between the Virtual and the Real World","year":"2009","abstract":"In this paper we present ideas that can help to close the gap between virtual reality and embedded interaction, which are usually assumed to be the two extremes of a dimension that describes mixed reality interaction.

A VR walking game for patients recovering from strokes was developed. Twenty physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and prosthetic-orthotic therapists were invited to evaluate the benefits of the games through questionnaires and interviews. Eighty percents of the therapists agreed or strongly agreed that the introduction of the VR walking game could help them to care for more post-stroke patients. The first prototype used a head-mounted display (HMD) to present the VR simulation and 12 therapists reported that the quality of HMD would cause potential disorientations in elderly patients. A second prototype with three panel-mounted displays was developed and results of further evaluation confirmed that the potential benefits of VR games in clinical management of patients recovering from strokes.

Design Prospective randomised controlled and blinded trial. Setting Seven gynaecological departments in the Zeeland region of Denmark. Participants 24 first and second year registrars specialising in gynaecology and obstetrics. Interventions Proficiency based virtual reality simulator training in laparoscopic salpingectomy and standard clinical education (controls). Main outcome measure The main outcome measure was technical performance assessed by two independent observers blinded to trainee and training status using a previously validated general and task specific rating scale. The secondary outcome measure was operation time in minutes. Results The simulator trained group (n=11) reached a median total score of 33 points (interquartile range 32-36 points), equivalent to the experience gained after 20-50 laparoscopic procedures, whereas the control group (n=10) reached a median total score of 23 (22-27) points, equivalent to the experience gained from fewer than five procedures (P<0.001). The median total operation time in the simulator trained group was 12 minutes (interquartile range 10-14 minutes) and in the control group was 24 (20-29) minutes (P<0.001). The observers' inter-rater agreement was 0.79. Conclusion Skills in laparoscopic surgery can be increased in a clinically relevant manner using proficiency based virtual reality simulator training.

METHOD: Sixteen children with cerebral palsy aged 8 to 12 years participated. They were observed during a variety of VR environments that were video recorded. The Pediatric Volitional Questionnaire (PVQ) was used to measure children's motivation. The PVQ provides insights into children's inner motives as well as how the virtual environment enhances or attenuates children's motives. Nine VR environments were randomly selected to score with the PVQ. RESULTS: Data were analyzed and descriptive statistics were calculated for modes and medians of total volition scores for each VR environment. Different environments produced varying levels of volitional behaviour. The features of environments that produced higher levels of volition included challenge, variability and competition. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The overall volitional scores of children with cerebral palsy in the current study indicate that VR play is a motivating activity and thus has potential as a successful intervention tool.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Cerebral","Male;","Outcome;","Behavior;","User-Computer","Palsy;","Playthings;","Female;","Play","and","Child","Treatment","Motivation;","Interface"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/29c7015ff22333bc201dcded8993e2488\/hci-uwb","author":["Florian Kern","Carla Winter","Dominik Gall","Ivo K\u00e4thner","Paul Pauli","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"Immersive Virtual Reality and Gamification Within Procedurally Generated Environments to Increase Motivation During Gait Rehabilitation","year":"2019","abstract":"Virtual Reality (VR) technology offers promising opportunities to improve traditional treadmill-based rehabilitation programs.

We evaluated the effect of the immersive rehabilitation system on motivation and affect. We conducted a repeated measures study with 36 healthy participants to compare the immersive program to a traditional rehabilitation program. Participants reported significant greater enjoyment, felt more competent and experienced higher decision freedom and meaningfulness in the immersive VR gait training compared to the traditional training. They experienced significantly lower physical demand, simulator sickness, and state anxiety, and felt less pressured while still perceiving a higher personal performance.

This study compares cadaveric temporal bone (CTB) simulation with the Voxel-Man TempoSurg (VT) virtual reality simulator in addressing these features.A questionnaire was designed comparing the VT with CTB. Fourteen trainees and six consultants completed the questionnaire after using the simulator.The VT is better at allowing repetitive practice, ease of control of difficulty, and capturing clinical and pathological variation. The VT is as good as CTB in curriculum integration, allowing multiple learning strategies, providing a controlled environment, individualising learning and defining benchmarks. It appears worse with regards to face validity and feedback.Virtual reality simulation and CTB have features that allow effective learning. Some of these are common to both, in some CTB is better and in others virtual reality is better.

Hands-on patient experience - the traditional apprenticeship method for teaching operations - may not apply because of the learning curve for skill acquisition and patient safety expectation. The paranasal sinuses and temporal bone have intricate anatomy with a significant amount of vital structures either within the surgical field or in close proximity. The current standard of surgical care in these areas involves the use of endoscopes, cameras and microscopes, requiring additional hand-eye coordination, an accurate command of fine motor skills, and a thorough knowledge of the anatomy under magnified vision. A surgeon's disorientation or loss of perspective can lead to complications, often catastrophic and occasionally lethal. These considerations define the ideal environment for surgical simulation; not surprisingly, significant research and validation of simulators in these areas have occurred.Virtual reality simulators are demonstrating validity as training and skills assessment tools.

As a result of this sensory mismatch, people associate negative symptoms with VR and sometimes avoid the technology altogether. To reconcile the two contradicting sensory perceptions, we investigate GVS to stimulate the vestibular canals behind our ears with low-current electrical signals that are specifically attuned to the visually displayed camera motion. We describe how to calibrate and generate the appropriate GVS signals in real-time for pre-recorded omnidirectional videos exhibiting ego-motion in all three spatial directions. For validation, we conduct an experiment presenting real-world 360\u00b0 videos shot from a moving first-person perspective in a VR head-mounted display.

The basic idea of the proposed method is to introduce a layer consisting of several fog nodes between clients and cloud server to offload a part of the rendering task which is conducted by the cloud server in conventional cloud games. We examine three techniques to reduce the latency in such a fog-assisted cloud game: 1) To maintain the consistency of the virtual game space, collision detection of virtual objects is conducted by the cloud server in a centralized manner; 2) To reflect subtle changes of the line of sight to the 3D game view, each client is assigned to a fog node and the head motion of the player acquired through HMD (Head-Mounted Display) is directly sent to the corresponding fog node; and 3) To offload a part of the rendering task, we separate the rendering of the background view from that of the foreground view, and migrate the former to other nodes including the cloud server. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by experiments with an AWS-based prototype system. It is confirmed that the proposed techniques achieve the latency of 32.3 ms, which is 66 % faster than the conventional systems.","tags":["3D","game","view","positional","computing","Cloud","of","tracking","fog","rendering"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/aircconline.com\/ijcnc\/V12N6\/12620cnc03.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21722831e51bb3b6be53612053b759b7e\/willwade","author":["D.

A pretest-posttest design was used. The relevant outcome of interest was upper extremity control as measured with the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST), item #6 of Subtest #5 of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP), and a measure of percent accuracy . The total scores on the QUEST indicated clinically significant changes in quality of upper extremity for two of the children. Changes were noted in other measures of upper extremity control for each child.Qualitative comments from the participants revealed a high degree of motivation, interest, pleasure, and opportunity for engagement in play activities not previously engaged in. Overall, this pilot study suggests the viability of a virtual reality play based intervention as part of the rehabilitation process for children with cerebral palsy.

The extent to which the EEG signal can be disturbed by the presence of VR sys- tems, however, has been barely investigated. This study outlines how to evaluate the compatibility of a given EEG-VR setup on the example of two commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs), the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro. We use a novel experimental protocol to compare the spectral composition between conditions with and without an HMD present during an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task. We found general artifacts at the line hum of 50 Hz, and additional HMD refresh rate artifacts (90 Hz) for the Oculus rift exclusively. Frequency components typically most interesting to non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz), however, remained largely unaffected. We observed similar topographies of visually-induced modulation of alpha band power for both HMD conditions in all subjects. Hence, the study introduces a necessary validation test for HMDs in combination with EEG and further promotes EEG as a potential biometric measurement method for psychophysical effects in VR systems.","tags":["vtimes","myown","interactive-opera"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2019-ieeevr-brain-activity-vr-preprint.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2570759f7e9456f7dd599074612dfaa06\/hci-uwb","author":["Marc Cavazza","Simon Hartley","Jean-Luc Lugrin","Mikael Le Bras"],"text":"Alternative Reality: a New Platform for Virtual Reality Art","year":"2003","abstract":null,"tags":["teeside"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"1581135696","url":"http:\/\/doi.acm.org\/10.1145\/1008653.1008672"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d005f73e4ea023640682863995051fc8\/dblp","author":["Marko Orel"],"text":"The potentials of virtual reality in entrepreneurship education.","year":"2020","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"Routledge","isbn":"9781003001874","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/books\/collections\/D2020.html#Orel20"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/278cd5b16f461b25b7d2313fdf36daf67\/n.doellinger","author":["David Mal","Erik Wolf","Nina D\u00f6llinger","Carolin Wienrich","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"The Impact of Avatar and Environment Congruence on Plausibility, Embodiment, Presence, and the Proteus Effect in Virtual Reality","year":"2023","abstract":"Many studies show the significance of the Proteus effect for serious virtual reality applications.

Plausibility, congruence, and their role have recently gained more and more attention. One of the latest models to describe XR experiences, the Congruence and Plausibility model (CaP), puts plausibility and congruence right in the center. However, it is unclear what influence they have on the overall XR experience and what influences our perceived plausibility rating. In this paper, we implemented four different incongruencies within a virtual reality scene using breaks in plausibility as an analogy to breaks in presence. These manipulations were either located on the cognitive or perceptual layer of the CaP model. They were also either connected to the task at hand or not. We tested these manipulations in a virtual bowling environment to see which influence they had. Our results show that manipulations connected to the task caused a lower perceived plausibility. Additionally, cognitive manipulations seem to have a larger influence than perceptual manipulations. We were able to cause a break in plausibility with one of our incongruencies. These results show a first direction on how the influence of plausibility in XR can be systematically investigated in the future.","tags":["myown","xrhub"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","isbn":"9798350328387","url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2023-ismar-bruebach-a-systematic-evaluation-of-incongruencies-preprint.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/205a8b14f9ebdfcffa0283025c1c5ac69\/dblp","author":["Riku Suomela","Jouka Mattila","Eero R\u00e4s\u00e4nen","Timo Koskinen"],"text":"Augmented Reality for a Casual User: Designing Tools for Interaction with the Virtual World.","year":"2002","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/digra\/cgdc2002.html#SuomelaMRK02"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2680b4d68fb9b41c3c82e846393e9679f\/alex_szykman","author":["Miao Song","Peter Grogono","Serguei A.

We discuss the design of the VR training. Then, we present the results of a between subject experiment (n=42) with three experimental conditions (control, training once, repeated training) investigating learning effects on subjects' negotiation skill and knowledge. In our case negotiation skill consists of negotiation outcome (final bid utility) and conversation skill (exploratory conversational choices in VR scenario), and negotiation knowledge is the subjects' quality of reflection upon filmed behavior of two negotiating actors. Our results confirm the hypothesis. We found significant effects of training on conversation skill and negotiation knowledge. We found a marginally significant effect of training on negotation outcome. As the effect of training on negotiation outcome was marginally significant and only present when controlling for overshadowing effects of the act of reflecting, we postulate that other learning approaches (e.g., instruction) are needed for trainees to use the information gained during the joint exploration phase of a negotiation for the construction of a bid. Our results are particularly important given the sparse availability of experimental studies that show learning effects of VR negotiation training, and gives additional support to those studies that do report possitive effects such as with the BiLAT system.","tags":["ACM"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","isbn":"9783642331961","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-642-33197-8_23"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/23cde58918f03337b423ccc961af43df3\/oberdoerfer","author":["Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","David Heidrich","Sandra Birnstiel","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"Enchanted by Your Surrounding?

The identification and separation of orthogonal presence components, i.e., the place illusion and the plausibility illusion, has been an accepted theoretical model describing Virtual Reality (VR) experiences for some time. This perspective article challenges this presence-oriented VR theory. First, we argue that a place illusion cannot be the major construct to describe the much wider scope of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR, AR, MR: or XR for short). Second, we argue that there is no plausibility illusion but merely plausibility, and we derive the place illusion caused by the congruent and plausible generation of spatial cues and similarly for all the current model\u2019s so-defined illusions.

Study Design: Cross-sectional educational design Methods: Five residents ranging from PGY-1 to PGY-4 were evaluated at three settings: 1) Virtual reality temporal bone simulator, 2) Temporal bone laboratory 3) Operating room. Using a previously validated checklist for mastoidectomy, faculty evaluated the residents for the following tasks: 1) Identification and definition of tegmen 2) Definition of sigmoid sinus and sino-dural angle. 3) Use of drill and 4) Overall surgical performance. The evaluations on virtual reality temporal bone simulator were then compared with the evaluations conducted in the operating room and the temporal bone laboratory. Results: The mean total score obtained for residents on VR temporal bone simulator was 2.54\u00b10.75, 3.13\u00b10.55 for OR, and 2.18\u00b10.29 for temporal bone laboratory. The mean total score obtained for all settings among Otology 1 was 2.27\u00b10.72, and for Otology 2 was 2.70\u00b10.68. Conclusion: The surgical performance on the VR temporal bone simulator is concordant with the temporal bone laboratory performance, which provides an indirect evidence of transferability of surgical skills to the OR. VR simulator can assist in learning technical skills for mastoidectomy procedure and attain surgical competency at a faster rate.","tags":["voxelman","t-vr-sim"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2a7e3b4b9e2363aa641c1a95bd688090f\/jvrb_regulski","author":["Alma Berneburg"],"text":"Presence in a Three-Dimensional Test Environment: Benefit or Threat to Market Research?","year":"2008","abstract":"In market research, the adoption of interactive virtualreality-techniques could be expected to contain many advantages: artificial lab environments could be designed in a more realistic manner and the consideration of \u201ctime to the market\u201d-factors could be improved.

These spaces arise from the solution of multi-objective optimisation problems with more than 3 objective functions which lead to high dimensional Pareto fronts. The 3-D representations of m-dimensional Pareto fronts, or their approximations, are constructed via similarity structure mappings between the original objective spaces and the 3-D space. Alpha shapes are introduced for the representation and compared with previous approaches based on convex hulls. In addition, the mappings minimising a measure of the amount of dissimilarity loss are obtained via genetic programming. This approach is preliminarily investigated using both theoretically derived high dimensional Pareto fronts for a test problem (DTLZ2) and practically obtained objective spaces for the 4 dimensional knapsack problem via multi-objective evolutionary algorithms like HLGA, NSGA, and VEGA. The improved representation captures more accurately the real nature of the m-dimensional objective spaces and the quality of the mappings obtained with genetic programming is equivalent to those computed with classical optimization algorithms.","tags":["genetic","algorithms,","programming"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE Press","isbn":"1424413400","url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2daadcc3958520a81190fa189380f3769\/peterkullmann","author":["Chiara Palmisano","Peter Kullmann","Ibrahem Hanafi","Marta Verrecchia","Marc Erich Latoschik","Andrea Canessa","Martin Fischbach","Ioannis Ugo Isaias"],"text":"A Fully-Immersive Virtual Reality Setup to Study Gait Modulation","year":"2022","abstract":"Objective: Gait adaptation to environmental challenges is fundamental for independent and safe community ambulation.

Other varieties of the so-called eXtended Realities (XR), e.g., Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR and MR) incorporate immersive features to a lesser degree and continuously combine spatial cues from the real physical space and the simulated virtual space. This blurred separation questions the applicability of the accumulated knowledge about the similarities of virtual presence and presence occurring in other varieties of XR, and corresponding outcomes. The present work bridges this gap by analyzing the construct of presence in mixed realities (MR). To achieve this, the following presents (1) a short review of definitions, dimensions, and measurements of presence in VR, and (2) the state of the art views on MR. Additionally, we (3) derived a working definition of MR, extending the Milgram continuum. This definition is based on entities reaching from real to virtual manifestations at one time point. Entities possess different degrees of referential power, determining the selection of the frame of reference. Furthermore, we (4) identified three research desiderata, including research questions about the frame of reference, the corresponding dimension of transportation, and the dimension of realism in MR. Mainly the relationship between the main aspects of virtual presence of immersive VR, i.e., the place-illusion, and the plausibility-illusion, and of the referential power of MR entities are discussed regarding the concept, measures, and design of presence in MR. Finally, (5) we suggested an experimental setup to reveal the research heuristic behind experiments investigating presence in MR. The present work contributes to the theories and the meaning of and approaches to simulate and measure presence in MR. We hypothesize that research about essential underlying factors determining user experience (UX) in MR simulations and experiences is still in its infancy and hopes this article provides an encouraging starting point to tackle related questions.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":"Frontiers","isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/frvir.2021.694315"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/25786713e0189a663752d3f78628e3c34\/jpstauffert","author":["Marc Erich Latoschik","Florian Kern","Jan-Philipp Stauffert","Andrea Bartl","Mario Botsch","Jean-Luc Lugrin"],"text":"Not Alone Here?!

These phenomena have been observed in both computer generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic projection systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for passive and active stereoscopic viewing and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we find that change blindness phenomena can be applied with a larger magnitude as compared to monoscopic viewing of a scene. We have also evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.","tags":["LOCUI","objects","ChangeBlindness","virtual","stadtmodellen","virtualreality","interactive"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE Press","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.mcm.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/06110000\/user_upload\/Paper\/IMG\/2010\/SBHW10.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2744fbab56501eeaf4519ca6ca14622e0\/florianheinrich","author":["Vuthea Chheang","Florian Heinrich","Fabian Joeres","Patrick Saalfeld","Roghayeh Barmaki","Bernhard Preim","Christian Hansen"],"text":"WiM-Based Group Navigation for Collaborative Virtual Reality","year":"2022","abstract":null,"tags":["imported","myown","florian.heinrich"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/25786713e0189a663752d3f78628e3c34\/hci-uwb","author":["Marc Erich Latoschik","Florian Kern","Jan-Philipp Stauffert","Andrea Bartl","Mario Botsch","Jean-Luc Lugrin"],"text":"Not Alone Here?!

It also shows that variety in avatar\/agent appearance might increase eeriness but might also stimulate an increased interest of participants about the environment.","tags":["ieee2019","myown","latoschik","vilearn"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/8643417"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/252ea6e8df2193bec18dbe624d6734447\/dblp","author":["Linda Daniela","Yipaer Aierken"],"text":"The educational perspective on virtual reality experiences of cultural heritage.","year":"2020","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"Routledge","isbn":"9781003001874","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/books\/collections\/D2020.html#DanielaA20"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2c3b5c5e6830f4b24d7d130b3fb772ee9\/cmcneile","author":["Joseph R.

Part of the reason for this is the prohibitive cost of immersive VR headsets or caves. This has changed with the advent of smartphone-based VR (along the lines of Google cardboard) which allows students to use smartphones and inexpensive plastic or cardboard viewers to enjoy stereoscopic VR simulations. We have completed the largest-ever such study on 627 students enrolled in calculus-based freshman physics at The Ohio State University. This initial study focused on student understanding of electric fields. Students were split into three treatments groups: VR, video, and static 2D images. Students were asked questions before, during, and after treatment. Here we present a preliminary analysis including overall post-pre improvement among the treatment groups, dependence of improvement on gender, and previous video game experience. Results on select questions are discussed.

Today, however, user evaluations of humanoid robots are often based on mediated depictions rather than actual observations or interactions with a robot, which holds true not least for scientific user studies. People can be confronted with robots in various modes of presentation, among them (1) 2D videos, (2) 3D, i.e., stereoscopic videos, (3) immersive Virtual Reality (VR), or (4) live on site. A systematic investigation into how such differential modes of presentation influence user perceptions of a robot is still lacking. Thus, the current study systematically compares the effects of different presentation modes with varying immersive potential on user evaluations of a humanoid service robot. Participants (N = 120) observed an interaction between a humanoid service robot and an actor either on 2D or 3D video, via a virtual reality headset (VR) or live. We found support for the expected effect of the presentation mode on perceived immediacy. Effects regarding the degree of human likeness that was attributed to the robot were mixed. The presentation mode had no influence on evaluations in terms of eeriness, likability, and purchase intentions. Implications for empirical research on humanoid robots and practice are discussed.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2021.633178"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27bc6188bb026ccb12c1215dc6123065e\/dblp","author":["Norma J.

Pain management of children is not ideal, and some children unable to tolerate traditional pharmacological agents. Virtual reality (VR) is a new and promising form of non-pharmacologic analgesia. This case study explored the use of VR analgesia with a 16-year-old patient with cerebral palsy participating in a twice-daily physiotherapy program following Single Event Multi-Level Surgery. Over 6 days, the patient spent half of his physiotherapy sessions using VR and the other half without (order randomized). Traditional pharmacological pain management was administered throughout the trial. Using a subjective pain scale (five faces denoting levels of pain), the patient's overall pain ratings whilst in the VR (experimental) condition were 41.2\\% less than those in the no-VR (control) condition. This case report provides the first evidence that VR may serve as a powerful non-pharmacologic analgesic for children following surgery.","tags":["Humans;","Postoperative","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Graphics;","Manipulations;","Measurement;","Computer-Assisted;","Analgesia;","User-Computer","Palsy;","Therapy,","Treatment","Bone","Extremity;","Simulation;","Lengthening;","Interface","Lower","Male;","Outcome;","Musculoskeletal","Pain","Pain;","Computer","Complications;","Osteotomy;"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/109493103322725405"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/274b2a531957e9a313784ba1d777a8598\/dblp","author":["Daniel Thalmann","Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann"],"text":"Virtual Humans for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality.","year":"2003","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","isbn":"0769518826","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/vr\/vr2003.html#ThalmannMT03"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2886e1007ea854c69fd06f86763ffd0bb\/s.vonmammen","author":["Samuel Truman"," Sebastian von Mammen"],"text":"An Integrated Design of World-in-Miniature Navigation in Virtual Reality","year":"2020","abstract":"Navigation is considered one of the most fundamental challenges in Virtual Reality (VR) and has been extensively researched 11.

Two neural network layers (output and last hidden) are used for the construction of simultaneous solutions for: a supervised classification of data patterns and an unsupervised similarity structure preservation between the original data matrix and its image in the new space. A set of spaces are constructed from selected solutions along the Pareto front. This strategy represents a conceptual improvement over spaces computed by single-objective optimisation. In addition, genetic programming (in particular gene expression programming) is used for finding analytic representations of the complex mappings generating the spaces (a composition of NDA and orthogonal principal components). The presented approach is domain independent and is illustrated via application to the geophysical prospecting of caves.","tags":["genetic","algorithms,","Gene","programming,","Programming","Expression"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2fffe33ecf1dced2ccdb833ba9d455de6\/dblp","author":["Yusuf Sermet","Ibrahim Demir"],"text":"Virtual and augmented reality applications for environmental science education and training.","year":"2020","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"Routledge","isbn":"9781003001874","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/books\/collections\/D2020.html#SermetD20"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/298d2c61373f5408d1e5887eff62ae43d\/hci-uwb","author":["Jean-Luc Lugrin","Marc Erich Latoschik","Michael Habel","Daniel Roth","Christian Seufert","Silke Grafe"],"text":"Breaking Bad Behaviors: A New Tool for Learning Classroom Management using Virtual Reality","year":"2016","abstract":"This article presents an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) system for training classroom management skills, with a specific focus on learning to manage disruptive student behaviour in face-to-face, one-to-many teaching scenarios.

Embodiment was induced by presenting the users\u2019 avatars to themselves in a virtual mirror.

Several measures were taken to analyze the effect of the appearance of the users\u2019 avatars as well as the effect of the appearance of the others\u2019 avatars on the users. The realistic avatars were rated significantly more human-like when used as avatars for the others and evoked a stronger acceptance in terms of virtual body ownership (VBO).

By far the most natural way to move through the real world is via locomotion like walking or running. The same should also be true for computer generated three-dimensional environments. Keeping such an active and dynamic ability to navigate through large-scale virtual scenes is of great interest for many 3D applications demanding locomotion, such as tourism, architecture or interactive entertainment. However, today it is still mostly impossible to freely walk through computer generated environments in order to actively explore them. The primary reason for this is the scientific and technological underdevelopment in this sector. While moving in the real world, sensory information such as vestibular, proprioceptive, and efferent copy signals as well as visual information create consistent multi-sensory cues that indicate one's own motion, i.e., acceleration, speed and direction of travel. Computer graphics environments were initially restricted to visual displays, combined with interaction devices, e.g. joystick or mouse, for providing (often unnatural) inputs to generate self-motion. Nowadays, more and more interaction devices, e.g., Nintendo's Wii or Sony's EyeToy, enable intuitive and natural interaction. In this context, many research groups are investigating natural, multimodal methods of generating self-motion in virtual worlds based on these consumer hardware. An obvious approach is to transfer the user's tracked head movements to changes of the camera in the virtual world by means of a one-to-one mapping. Then, a one meter movement in the real world is mapped to a one meter movement of the virtual camera in the corresponding direction in the virtual environment (VE). This technique has the drawback that the user's movements are restricted by a limited range of the tracking sensors, e.g. optical cameras, and a rather small workspace in the real world. The size of the virtual world often differs from the size of the tracked space so that a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not possible. Thus, concepts for virtual locomotion methods are needed that enable walking over large distances in the virtual world while remaining within a relatively small space in the real world. In this tutorial we will present an overview about the development of locomotion interfaces for computer generated virtual environments ranging from desktop-based camera manipulations simulating walking, and different walking metaphors for virtual reality (VR)-based environments to state-of-the-art hardware-based solutions that enable omni-directional and unlimited real walking through virtual worlds.","tags":["LOCUI","virtual","walking","tutorial","experiences","jvrc"],"pub-type":"book","publisher":"ACM","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/viscg.uni-muenster.de\/publications\/2010\/BMC10"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21250550f13f78fe812822bb4f9a4da99\/ht09","author":["Mohammed Haouach","Gilles Venturini","Christiane Guinot"],"text":"A 3D Hypermedia With Biomedical Stereoscopic Images: From Creation to Exploration in Virtual Reality","year":"2009","abstract":"We present in this paper a new method for building and exploring a 3D hypermedia in virtual reality and for a biomedical domain.

AR and VR in Architecture & Planning were introduced as assisting tools and has helped generate multiple design options, expanded possibilities of visualization, and provided us with more enhanced, detailed, and specific experience in real-time; enabling us to see the resultsof work on hand well before the commencement of the project. These tools are further developed for city development decisions, helping citizens interact with local authorities, access public services, and plan their commute. After reviewing multiple research papers, it had been observed that each one is moving forward with the changes brought by it, without entirely understanding its role.

The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and wordgesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/10049665\/"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2880ace5d388ad45e6d1331a61b0f71fa\/hci-uwb","author":null,"text":"IEEE 6th Workshop on Software Engineering and Architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems (SEARIS)","year":"2013","abstract":null,"tags":["AR","SEARIS","myown","realtime","software","workshop","engineering","interactive","VR","architectures"],"pub-type":"proceedings","publisher":"IEEE digital library","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6784150"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2908ceae20e079084a0b480dedc64e299\/hci-uwb","author":null,"text":"IEEE 10th Workshop on Software Engineering and Architectures for Realtime Interactive Systems (SEARIS)","year":"2017","abstract":null,"tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"proceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/29995492bc245b659d94fa26b72ce3385\/itc","author":["Joris Heyse","Maria Torres Vega","Tim Wauters","Femke De Backere","Filip De Turck"],"text":"Effects of Adaptive Streaming Optimizations on the Perception of 360\u00b0 Virtual Reality Video","year":"2018","abstract":"As the demand of Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming to mobile devices increases, novel optimization transport techniques need to be designed to cope with these ultra-high-bandwidth video services. One approach currently attracting attention is the application of adaptive tile-based streaming solutions to the VR video arena. The VR videos are encoded at different quality levels, temporally divided into segments and spatially split into tiles. During the streaming, each of these tiles can be transmitted independently according to its location within the frame (i.e., within or outside of the user's field of view). These methods open a new venue for bandwidth and latency optimization for the streaming of VR videos. However, the effect of the different adaptive streaming optimizations on the end-user perception is still an open research topic. In this demo, we present a VR video platform to experience the working principles of adaptive tile-based VR video streaming services. Through different tiling approaches, bandwidth conditions and viewport algorithms, it allows the users to explore the effects that each optimization has on the perception of the service. In addition, the platform provides real-time bandwidth savings and objective Quality of Experience (QoE) measurements to provide a quantitative analysis of the optimizations effects. This demo aims to provide a common playground for researchers to benchmark, and evaluate the performance of their optimization solutions.","tags":["itc","itc30","Session_3.2:_Madness_Session"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/gitlab2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/itc-conference\/itc-conference-public\/-\/raw\/master\/itc30\/Heyse18ITC30.pdf?inline=true"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/289f0862bb7fb3752a413f94324aa8063\/dblp","author":["Faisal Z.

An empirical test revealed no difference in the user's HRV between VRD technology and LCD technology. Consequently, there seems to be a comparable user informational strain regarding the display types.","tags":["Augmented_Reality","Belastungsfaktor","Herzschlagfrequenz","Arbeitsbelastung","Virtuelle_Realit\u00e4t","mmspub"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/10803548.2003.11076579"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22db108ac460f6105118d9462cb6347e3\/dblp","author":["Oli Howson"],"text":"An exploration of the impact of augmented and Virtual Reality within compulsory education.","year":"2020","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"Routledge","isbn":"9781003001874","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/books\/collections\/D2020.html#Howson20"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2936b9a317c819778e259404ca6d4690d\/c.wienrich","author":["Nina D\u00f6llinger","Carolin Wienrich","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"Challenges and Opportunities of Immersive Technologies for Mindfulness Meditation: A Systematic Review","year":"2021","abstract":null,"tags":["myown","journal_paper","full_paper","c.wienrich","vitras","change_experience"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2b1898450e896a05f70e99feb049f05e9\/mcm","author":["Frank Steinicke","Timo Ropinski","Klaus H.

EFs are important cognitive functions for athletes. They are a relevant quality that distinguishes amateurs from professionals. Method: The system is based on immersive technology, hence, the user interacts naturally and experiences a training session in a virtual world. The proposed system has a modular design supporting the extension of various so-called game modes. Game modes combine selected game mechanics with specific simulation content to target particular training aspects. The system architecture decouples selection\/parameterization and analysis of training sessions via a coaching app from an Unity3D-based VR simulation core. Monitoring of user performance and progress is recorded by a database that sends the necessary feedback to the coaching app for analysis. Results: The system is tested for VR-critical performance criteria to reveal the usefulness of a new interaction paradigm in the cognitive training and analysis of EFs. Subjective ratings for overall usability show that the design as VR application enhances the user experience compared to a traditional desktop app; whereas the new, unfamiliar interaction paradigm does not negatively impact the effort for using the application. Conclusion: The system can provide immersive training of EF in a fully virtual environment, eliminating potential distraction. It further provides an easy-to-use analyzes tool to compare user but also an automatic, adaptive training mode.","tags":["myown","own"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":"Frontiers","isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fpsyg.2022.754732\/full"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/215c0531640d86ae45be9248d4bbdd6ea\/sia-bib","author":["Florian Kern","Peter Kullmann","Elisabeth Ganal","Kristof Korwisi","Rene Stingl","Florian Niebling","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"Off-The-Shelf Stylus: Using XR Devices for Handwriting and Sketching on Physically Aligned Virtual Surfaces","year":"2021","abstract":"This article introduces the Off-The-Shelf Stylus (OTSS), a framework for 2D interaction (in 3D) as well as for handwriting and sketching with digital pen, ink, and paper on physically aligned virtual surfaces in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR: XR for short).

Cortical activation and associated motor development were measured before and after VR therapy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and standardized motor tests. Before VR therapy, the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices (SMCs) and ipsilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) were predominantly activated during affected elbow movement. After VR therapy, the altered activations disappeared and the contralateral SMC was activated. This neuroplastic change was associated with enhanced functional motor skills including reaching, self-feeding, and dressing. These functions were not possible before the intervention.

However, very little objective evidence is available yet on the matter. This study was conducted to identify factors that influence surgeons' performance, as measured by a virtual reality computer simulator for laparoscopic surgery.This study included 25 surgical residents who had limited experience with laparoscopic surgery, having performed fewer than 10 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The participants were registered according to their gender, hand dominance, and experience with computer games. All of the participants performed 10 repetitions of the six tasks on the Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR) within 1 month. Assessment of laparoscopic skills was based on three parameters measured by the simulator: time, errors, and economy of hand movement.Differences in performance existed between the compared groups. Men completed the tasks in less time than women ( p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test), but there was no statistical difference between the genders in the number of errors and unnecessary movements. Individuals with right hand dominance performed fewer unnecessary movements ( p = 0.045, Mann-Whitney test), and there was a trend toward better results in terms of time and errors among the residence with right hand dominance than among those with left dominance. Users of computer games made fewer errors than nonusers ( p = 0.035, Mann-Whitney test).The study provides objective evidence of a difference in laparoscopic skills between surgeons differing gender, hand dominance, and computer experience.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted at the Imperial College Virtual Reality Surgical Skills laboratory amongst 25 trainees and nine senior gynaecologists. Participants performed two sessions of salpingectomy and salpingotomy procedures on a VR simulator to assess construct validity. Nine novices performed ten such sessions to enable assessment of the learning curve. The relationship between cognitive load and the dexterity parameters was assessed. Simulator fidelity was reported by experienced and intermediate level gynaecologists. Statistical analyses utilised non-parametric tests, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Learning curves were assessed using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Relationship between dexterity metrics and cognitive load was performed using Spearman's rank order correlation. RESULTS: Salpingectomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken by experienced, intermediate and novice gynaecologists (median 170 vs. 191 vs. 313s (P=0.003) respectively) and movements (median 200 vs. 267 vs. 376s, P=0.045). Salpingotomy demonstrated construct validity for time taken (median 183 vs. 191 vs. 306s, P=<0.001) and movements (median 210 vs. 233 vs. 328s, P=0.005). Learning curve analysis for salpingectomy displayed a plateau for time taken after the eighth session, and the fourth session for movements. Salpingotomy displayed a plateau after the eighth session for both time taken and movements. Cognitive load correlated significantly with dexterity parameters. The fidelity scores were not significantly different between the two procedures (P=0.619). CONCLUSION: The LAP Mentor VR laparoscopic simulator is a valid and effective tool for training novice surgeons in ectopic pregnancy surgery. Reduction in cognitive load significantly correlates with the learning curves.","tags":["cognitiveload"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ep.fjernadgang.kb.dk\/pubmed\/23608628"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/253e316e9797842ebe49db7643944e219\/davidmal","author":["Nina D\u00f6llinger","Erik Wolf","David Mal","Stephan Wenninger","Mario Botsch","Marc Erich Latoschik","Carolin Wienrich"],"text":"Resize Me!

While generally presumed innocuous, recent studies have demonstrated that motion data actually has the potential to uniquely identify VR users. In this study, we go a step further, showing that a variety of private user information can be inferred just by analyzing motion data recorded from VR devices. We conducted a large-scale survey of VR users (N=1,006) with dozens of questions ranging from background and demographics to behavioral patterns and health information. We then obtained VR motion samples of each user playing the game \"Beat Saber,\" and attempted to infer their survey responses using just their head and hand motion patterns. Using simple machine learning models, over 40 personal attributes could be accurately and consistently inferred from VR motion data alone. Despite this significant observed leakage, there remains limited awareness of the privacy implications of VR motion data, highlighting the pressing need for privacy-preserving mechanisms in multi-user VR applications.","tags":["myown","prima","schell"],"pub-type":"misc","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2305.19198"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/23d7df9695368bfcffbb8257f786b7fc1\/dblp","author":["Pei Wu","Ping An","Jian Ma"],"text":"Quality Assessment of Virtual Reality Videos.","year":"2018","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Springer","isbn":"9789811381386","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/iftc\/iftc2018.html#WuA018"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2cacfe26c128a72846ea8ca59b3c8c8b4\/dblp","author":["Omid Abari","Dinesh Bharadia","Austin Duffield","Dina Katabi"],"text":"Enabling High-Quality Untethered Virtual Reality.","year":"2017","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"USENIX Association","isbn":"9781931971379","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/nsdi\/nsdi2017.html#AbariBDK17"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2c73349e2cde8470b7b91c45efeb87fd6\/dblp","author":["Omid Abari"],"text":"Enabling High-Quality Untethered Virtual Reality.","year":"2017","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"9781450351430","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/mobicom\/mmnets2017.html#Abari17"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21e7c3acacaf80807e60c9f811cb3ed41\/dblp","author":["Melanie A.

Children with spastic CP completed ankle selective motor control exercises using a virtual reality (VR) exercise system and conventional (Conv) exercises. Ankle movements were recorded with an electrogoniometer. Children and their parents were asked to comment on their interest in the exercise programs. Greater fun and enjoyment were expressed during the VR exercises. Children completed more repetitions of the Conv exercises, but the range of motion and hold time in the stretched position were greater during VR exercises. These data suggest that using VR to elicit or guide exercise may improve exercise compliance and enhance exercise effectiveness.","tags":["Humans;","Adolescent;","Motor","Cerebral","Attitude","Patient","Motion,","Movement;","Range","Computer-Assisted;","Compliance;","Skills;","Ankle","User-Computer","Palsy;","Female;","to","Therapy,","Simulation;","Interface","Child;","Joint;","Male;","Ankle;","Muscle,","Skeletal;","of","Computer","Computers;","Articular;"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/cpb.2006.9.123"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20958e28ec93702bbd7d5b44587d6e0a7\/dblp","author":["Andrew Munoz","Christopher Lewis","Nicholas Bolling","William Zandbergen","Connor Scully-Allison","Vinh D.

We are delighted to be part of the program of IEEE VR 2008, in Reno, Nevada. These proceedings contain the 15 accepted contributions, which we believe are thought provoking and representative of the current state of the art in designing Virtual and Augmented Reality systems. We are expecting SEARIS to become the premier vent to publish and discuss these systems\u00e2\u20ac\u0090related issues, as there is currently no other veenue for these topics. In previous years, several researchers have organized related workshops and loosely arranged themselves as an unofficial interest group during past events. Their goal was to create a forum where researchers from all directions in the broad field of Virtual and Augmented Reality can contribute and debate their respective technical approaches. This work\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 mshop provides a face\u00e2\u20ac\u0090to\u00e2\u20ac\u0090face opportunity to further support this emerging project. Several approaches have been developed and utilized in the field of Realtime Interactive Systems RIS. Virtual, Augmented, Virtualized, in general Mixed Realities, as well as real\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 time simulation and computer games led to manifold inspiring solutions for RIS developments in research and production. However, it is an ongoing challenge to identify and sepa\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 rate both novel results and well known solutions in any new system. The goal of this workshop is to analyze and structure the current state\u00e2\u20ac\u0090of\u00e2\u20ac\u0090the\u00e2\u20ac\u0090art in RIS software engineering and architectures. We want to identify common as well as novel paradigms, concepts, methods, and techniques that support technical developments required in this field. A unified presentation of systems will allow us to support research and development in a more efficient way, and will provide a valuable source of information for future developments. This workshop is ur first integrated attempt to address the complex issue of RIS development and to sum\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 omarize the work our community is doing. Arranging the contributions into sections of similar key aspects was a difficult process. Many contributions could be grouped according to several aspects. In fact, it is one of the workshop's goals to identify such key aspects and many authors are shedding light onto several ey issues. We apologize for any ambiguity here. In the end, we needed a good structure and ence we gr kh ouped the papers into 4 main sections: * Systems. Six development systems are presented InTml, Lightning, FlowVR, OpenMASK VISTA, and MORGAN * Abstraction Is \u00e2\u20ac\u0090 sues. Two papers address the issues of reusable VE platforms and alterna tives to scene graphs. * Special Issues. In this section we collect papers related to the implementation of RIS in particular platforms, such as mobile systems, multi\u00e2\u20ac\u0090rate systems, and Mixed Reality. * Semantic and Dynamic Modeling. The four papers in this section show models for expli\u00e2\u20ac\u0090 citly describing semantic (i.e. \u00e4 chair is on the floor\") and dynamic information. * Semantic and Dynamic Modeling.

Multimodal and Unimodal Interaction for Open Creative Design Tasks in Virtual Reality","year":"2020","abstract":"Multimodal Interfaces (MMIs) have been considered to provide promising interaction paradigms for Virtual Reality (VR) for some time. However, they are still far less common than unimodal interfaces (UMIs). This paper presents a summative user study comparing an MMI to a typical UMI for a design task in VR. We developed an application targeting creative 3D object manipulations, i.e., creating 3D objects and modifying typical object properties such as color or size. The associated open user task is based on the Torrence Tests of Creative Thinking. We compared a synergistic multimodal interface using speech-accompanied pointing\/grabbing gestures with a more typical unimodal interface using a hierarchical radial menu to trigger actions on selected objects. Independent judges rated the creativity of the resulting products using the Consensual Assessment Technique. Additionally, we measured the creativity-promoting factors flow, usability, and presence. Our results show that the MMI performs on par with the UMI in all measurements despite its limited flexibility and reliability. These promising results demonstrate the technological maturity of MMIs and their potential to extend traditional interaction techniques in VR efficiently.","tags":["ewolf","myown","mmi"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","isbn":"9781450375818","url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2020-icmi-1169-preprint.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22cc7a67cabe98d8155cd12287d61c728\/dblp","author":["Noureddine Elmqaddem"],"text":"Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in Education.

In this paper, we present an experiment investigating the difference in time experience with and without a virtual body in VR, also known as avatar. The process of substituting a person's body with a virtual body is called avatar embodiment. Numerous studies demonstrated interesting perceptual, emotional, behavioral, and psychological effects caused by avatar embodiment. However, the relations between time perception and avatar embodiment are still unclear. Whether or not the presence or absence of an avatar is already influencing time perception is still open to question. Therefore, we conducted a between-subjects design with and without avatar embodiment as well as a real condition (avatar vs. no-avatar vs. real). A group of 105 healthy subjects had to wait for seven and a half minutes in a room without any distractors (e.g., no window, magazine, people, decoration) or time indicators (e.g., clocks, sunlight). The virtual environment replicates the real physical environment. Participants were unaware that they will be asked to estimate their waiting time duration as well as describing their experience of the passage of time at a later stage. Our main finding shows that the presence of an avatar is leading to a significantly faster perceived passage of time. It seems to be promising to integrate avatar embodiment in future VR time-based therapy applications as they potentially could modulate a user's perception of the passage of time. We also found no significant difference in time perception between the real and the VR conditions (avatar, no-avatar), but further research is needed to better understand this outcome.","tags":["oberdoerfer","myown"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/frvir.2021.658509"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2654e263893f21545b63ba557f6d8eba9\/dblp","author":["Karl Edlinger"],"text":"Virtual Reality, Cyberspace and Living Organisms: Towards a New Understanding of Perception and Cognition?","year":"2001","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Peter Lang","isbn":"3631383452","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/cognitive\/cognitive2001.html#Edlinger01"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2aeb12ec976da84486479a75850b7c835\/hci-uwb","author":["Oct\u00e1via Madeira","Daniel Gromer","Marc Erich Latoschik","Paul Pauli"],"text":"Effects of Acrophobic Fear and Trait Anxiety on Human Behavior in a Virtual Elevated Plus-Maze","year":"2021","abstract":"The Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) is a well-established apparatus to measure anxiety in rodents, i.e. animals exhibiting an increased relative time spent in the closed versus the open arms are considered anxious.

Numerous studies demonstrated interesting perceptual, emotional, behavioral, and psychological effects caused by avatar embodiment. However, the relations between time perception and avatar embodiment are still unclear. Whether or not the presence or absence of an avatar is already influencing time perception is still open to question. Therefore, we conducted a between-subjects design with and without avatar embodiment as well as a real condition (avatar vs. no-avatar vs. real). A group of 105 healthy subjects had to wait for seven and a half minutes in a room without any distractors (e.g., no window, magazine, people, decoration) or time indicators (e.g., clocks, sunlight). The virtual environment replicates the real physical environment. Participants were unaware that they will be asked to estimate their waiting time duration as well as describing their experience of the passage of time at a later stage. Our main finding shows that the presence of an avatar is leading to a significantly faster perceived passage of time. It seems to be promising to integrate avatar embodiment in future VR time-based therapy applications as they potentially could modulate a user's perception of the passage of time. We also found no significant difference in time perception between the real and the VR conditions (avatar, no-avatar), but further research is needed to better understand this outcome.","tags":["oberdoerfer","myown"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/frvir.2021.658509"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2262ee8256ba07acc08dee56a5d11cf81\/hci-uwb","author":["Fabian Unruh","Maximilian Landeck","Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","Jean-Luc Lugrin","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"The Influence of Avatar Embodiment on Time Perception - Towards VR for Time-Based Therapy","year":"2021","abstract":"Psycho-pathological conditions, such as depression or schizophrenia, are often accompanied by a distorted perception of time. People suffering from this conditions often report that the passage of time slows down considerably and that they are stuck in time. Virtual Reality (VR) could potentially help to diagnose and maybe treat such mental conditions.

Consequently, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has investigated approaches that strengthen mindfulness, i.e., by inventing multimedia technologies to support mindfulness meditation. These approaches often use smartphones, tablets, or consumer-grade desktop systems to allow everyday usage in users' private lives or in the scope of organized therapies. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR; in short: XR) significantly extend the design space for such approaches. XR covers a wide range of potential sensory stimulation, perceptive and cognitive manipulations, content presentation, interaction, and agency.

However, a successful exploitation of XR that strengthens mindfulness requires a systematic analysis of the potential interrelation and influencing mechanisms between XR technology, its properties, factors, and phenomena and existing models and theories of the construct of mindfulness. This article reports such a systematic analysis of XR-related research from HCI and life sciences to determine the extent to which existing research frameworks on HCI and mindfulness can be applied to XR technologies, the potential of XR technologies to support mindfulness, and open research gaps. Fifty papers of ACM Digital Library and National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (PubMed) with and without empirical efficacy evaluation were included in our analysis. The results reveal that at the current time, empirical research on XR-based mindfulness support mainly focuses on therapy and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, most of the currently investigated XR-supported mindfulness interactions are limited to vocally guided meditations within nature-inspired virtual environments. While an analysis of empirical research on those systems did not reveal differences in mindfulness compared to non-mediated mindfulness practices, various design proposals illustrate that XR has the potential to provide interactive and body-based innovations for mindfulness practice. We propose a structured approach for future work to specify and further explore the potential of XR as mindfulness-support. The resulting framework provides design guidelines for XR-based mindfulness support based on the elements and psychological mechanisms of XR interactions.","tags":["myown","ndoel","vitras","change_experience"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/frvir.2021.644683"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2b4ef36a6eca6f075d62fcf28b5d71eb2\/dblp","author":["Hyunjung Shim","Seungkyu Lee"],"text":"Automatic color realism enhancement for virtual reality.","year":"2012","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","isbn":"9781467312479","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/vr\/vr2012.html#ShimL12"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27f03aab361cf9dee3c612a6b545a854c\/punithakumar","author":["Y.

Simulator X is targeted at Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and computer games. It provides a foundation and testbed for a variety of different application models. The current research architecture is based on the actor model to support fine grained concurrency and parallelism. Its design follows the minimize coupling and maximize cohesion software engineering principle. A distributed world state and execution scheme is combined with an object-centered world view based on an entity model. Entities conceptually aggregate properties internally represented by state variables. An asynchronous event mechanism allows intra- and interprocess communication between the simulation actors. An extensible world interface uses an ontology-based semantic annotation layer to provide a coherent world view of the resulting distributed world state and execution scheme to application developers. The world interface greatly simplifies configurability and the semantic layer provides a solid foundation for the integration of different Artificial Intelligence components. The current architecture is implemented in Scala using the Java virtual machine. This choice additionally fosters low-level scalability, portability, and reusability.","tags":["myown","simx"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2011-simulator-x-latoschik.pdf"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/26c446cfc721d1604792d160d81c37060\/dblp","author":["Magdalena Balazinska","Luis Ceze","Alvin Cheung","Brian Curless","Steven M.

While an analysis of empirical research on those systems did not reveal differences in mindfulness compared to non-mediated mindfulness practices, various design proposals illustrate that XR has the potential to provide interactive and body-based innovations for mindfulness practice. We propose a structured approach for future work to specify and further explore the potential of XR as mindfulness-support. The resulting framework provides design guidelines for XR-based mindfulness support based on the elements and psychological mechanisms of XR interactions.","tags":["myown","vitras"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/frvir.2021.644683"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2e2f546ac4b732fd2e8489df3102c9277\/hci-uwb","author":["Marc Cavazza","Jean-Luc Lugrin","Simon Hartley","Paolo Libardi","Matthew J.

We have developed a number of spatial interaction techniques that optically capture the device\u2032s movement and orientation relative to a visual marker. Such physical interactions in 3D space enable manipulative control of mobile games. In addition to acting as a physical controller that recognizes multiple game-dependent gestures, the mobile device augments the camera view with graphical overlays. We describe three game prototypes that use ubiquitous product packaging and other passive media as backgrounds for handheld augmentation. The prototypes can be realized on widely available off-the-shelf hardware and require only minimal setup and infrastructure support.","tags":["Tracking","Handheld_Devices","DiPP","Embodied_User_Interfaces","4.2007","4(2007)5","Visual_Markers","Open_Access","PerGames2006","Journal_of_Virtual_Reality_and_Broadcasting","Mobile_Devices","AR","Augmented_Reality","Visual_Codes","[Roh07]","Peer_Reviewed","Portable_Device","JVRB","Interaction_Techniques","Cell_Phone","Digital_Peer_Publishing_Initiative","Camera_Phones","Pervasive_Gaming"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"urn:nbn:de:0009-6-7939"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2c2c45d5dd53be597c9ac09c9c70af51d\/dblp","author":["Ozan \u00d6zkan","\u00d6zhan Ting\u00f6y"],"text":"Collaborative Engineering and Virtual Prototyping Within Virtual Reality.","year":"2019","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"Springer","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/reference\/ecgg\/1.html#OzkanT19"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2af7dabf57a0f0b966f3d66ef5fc674f5\/dblp","author":null,"text":"New Perspectives on Virtual and Augmented Reality - Finding New Ways to Teach in a Transformed Learning Environment","year":"2020","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"book","publisher":"Routledge","isbn":"9781003001874","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/books\/collections\/D2020.bht"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2288a761de786da7809c079db94f84c16\/lugrinj","author":["Marc Cavazza","Jean-Luc Lugrin","Sean Crooks","Alok Nandi","Mark Palmer","Marc Le Renard"],"text":"Causality and Virtual Reality Art","year":"2005","abstract":null,"tags":["myown","intelligent_virtual_environments","causality","digital_arts"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"1595930256","url":"http:\/\/doi.acm.org\/10.1145\/1056224.1056228"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2bd2643051f464dca2b14023e30870850\/dblp","author":["Sandra Malpica","Ana Serrano","Marcos Allue","Manuel G.

The rehabilitation of gait disorders in multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke patients is often based on conventional treadmill training. Virtual reality (VR)-based treadmill training can increase motivation and improve therapy outcomes. Objective. The present study aimed at (1) demonstrating the feasibility and acceptance of an immersive virtual reality application (presented via head-mounted display, HMD) for gait rehabilitation with patients, and (2) compare its effects to a semi-immersive presentation (via a monitor) and a conventional treadmill training without VR. Methods and results. 36 healthy participants and 14 persons with MS or stroke participated in each of the three experimental conditions. For both groups, the walking speed in the HMD condition was higher than in treadmill training without VR. Healthy participants reported a higher motivation after the HMD condition as compared with the other conditions. Importantly, no side effects in the sense of simulator sickness occurred and usability ratings were high. Most of the healthy study participants (89 %) and patients (71 %) preferred the HMD-based training among the three conditions and most patients could imagine using it more frequently. Conclusion. The study demonstrated the feasibility of combining a treadmill training with immersive VR. Due to its high usability and low side effects, the immersive system could serve as a valid alternative to conventional treadmill training in gait rehabilitation. It might be particularly suited for patients to improve training motivation and training outcome e. g. the walking speed compared with treadmill training using no or only semi-immersive VR.","tags":["myown","homecoming"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12984-021-00848-w"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2698f21805fe7b15e3b9c2f6502cabeab\/dblp","author":["Rainer P.

However, EEG measurements are highly susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in healthy subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artifacts, especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of 90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected. Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings, at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary devices.","tags":["myown","hci-uwb"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnins.2021.733673"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/29a38a8f110e1dffdac33694c84c1f00b\/dblp","author":["Shi-Kuo Chang","Maria Francesca Costabile","Stefano Levialdi"],"text":"Virtual Reality as an Aid to Visual Querying.","year":"1995","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/sebd\/sebd1995.html#ChangCL95"},{"search_string":"virtual reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2762e53489eaf6aad8ccdb6fbe3987eb4\/dblp","author":["Lauren Clack","Christian Hirt","Marcel Wenger","Dirk Saleschus","Andreas M.

Based on a tangible MR interface approach, Tiles is a transparent user interface that allows users to seamlessly interact with both virtual and physical objects. It also introduces a consistent MR interface model, providing a set of tools that allows users to dynamically add, remove, copy, duplicate and annotate virtual objects anywhere in the 3D physical workspace. Although our interaction techniques are broadly applicable, we ground them in an application for rapid prototyping and evaluation of aircraft instrument panels.

Mixed reality games use these technologies to entertain, motivate, educate, and inspire. We understand mixed reality games as goal-directed, structured play experiences that are not fully contained by virtual or physical worlds. They transform existing technologies, relationships, and places into platforms for gameplay. While the design of mixed reality games has received increasing attention across multiple disciplines, a focus on the collaborative potential of mixed reality formats, such as augmented and alternate reality games, has been lacking. We believe the CSCW community can play an essential and unique role in examining and designing the next generation of mixed reality games and technologies that support them. To this end, we seek to bring together researchers, designers, and players to advance an integrated mixed reality games' research canon and outline key opportunities and challenges for future research and development.","tags":["myown","social","reality","alternate","mixed","cscw","gamification","sciences","augmented","design","and","behavioral","games","theory"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"9781450310512","url":"http:\/\/doi.acm.org\/10.1145\/2141512.2141517"},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2f71c139f0f9b037556744ae5e0f1a74b\/jvrb_regulski","author":["Helmut Seibert","Patrick D\u00e4hne"],"text":"System Architecture of a Mixed Reality Framework","year":"2006","abstract":"In this paper the software architecture of a framework which simplifies the development of applications in the area of Virtual and Augmented Reality is presented.

The flexibility and the advantages of the presented framework are explained on the basis of an exemplary implementation of a classic Augmented Realityapplication and its extension to a collaborative remote expert scenario.","tags":["3(2006)7","DiPP","Peer-Reviewed","GRAPP2006","Mixed_Reality","Journal_of_Virtual_Reality_and_Broadcasting","Augmented_Reality","[SD06]","Data-Flow_Management","Distributed_Systems","3.2006","JVRB","Digital_Peer_Publishing_License"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.jvrb.org\/3.2006\/grapp2006specialissue\/777"},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2b65fcb73470f460722b4806753465eee\/flint63","author":null,"text":"The Engineering of Mixed Reality Systems","year":"2010","abstract":"Mixed reality computer systems aim to fuse digital and physical information and features, either as an augmentation of real-world environments or as a means of providing physically-based interaction with computer-based systems. So - for example - museum displays can be augmented with added information about their history and provenance, and this information delivered to a visitor via their mobile telephone as they pass in front of the display. An increasing number of systems are exploiting mixed reality but to date there are no systematic methods, techniques or guidelines for the development of such systems. In bringing together contributions on a broad range of mixed reality development issues this book provides a sound theoretical foundation for a disciplined approach to mixed reality engineering. Divided into three parts, interaction design, software design and implementation, this book brings together state of the art developments in the engineering of mixed reality systems, addressing issues at these three levels. Part 1 covers generic and specific mixed reality design elements and provides an overview of the design method; Part 2 addresses technical solutions for interaction techniques, development tools and a global view of the mixed reality software development process. Finally part 3 contains detailed case studies to highlight the application of mixed reality in a variety of fields including aviation, architecture, emergency management, games, and healthcare. Multimodal and tangible interaction designers, systems engineers working in augmented reality and ubiquitous systems, human factors researchers, and others interested in the use of mixed reality techniques in their work, will find this book a useful addition to their bookshelf.","tags":["development","software","crisis","book","ai","graphics","team","multimodal","01624","interface","health","3d","103","management","design","interaction","user","springer","embedded","architecture"],"pub-type":"book","publisher":"Springer","isbn":"9781848827325","url":""},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2c39222a56081d139ced32fa3bb40bf95\/flint63","author":["Petri Selonen","Petros Belimpasakis","Yu You","Timo Pylv\u00e4n\u00e4inen","Severi Uusitalo"],"text":"Mixed Reality Web Service Platform","year":"2012","abstract":"This paper presents a RESTful Web service platform for applications for both Web browsers and mobile clients.

The industrial research project AVIGLE explores novel approaches to multimodal remote sensing by using a swarm of Miniature Un- manned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs), which are equipped with different sensing and network technologies. The acquired data will be sent in quasi-real time to a ground control sta- tion, where a VE will be generated automatically. Although this approach introduces a new low-cost alternative to the traditional remote sensing processes, it opens up numerous research and engineering challenges. In this position paper we introduce a mixed reality (MR)-based simulation framework, which has been developed in the scope of the AVIGLE project. The main idea for this framework is to create a con- trolled environment in which parts of the system are real, whereas other parts are virtual and can be simulated for testing purposes.

The clues involved people making drawings or rubbings on paper at a variety of locations. The paper was then electronically tagged and used to interact with a story tent. This consisted of a tarpaulin structure with projections on either side. A Radio Frequency ID tag reader and ultra violet light were positioned inside the tent. When placed on the tag reader, each paper clue revealed an historic 3D environment of the castle from the location at which the clue was found. \u2018Secret writing\u2019 revealed the story of a character at this location, while 2D images on the tent displayed corresponding scenes from this historical period. Visitors to the castle over 4 days took part in this experience.

Even when step by step instructions are available, most bystanders do not attempt resuscitation due to panic or fear of failing, often at the cost of the victim's life. We propose Mixed Reality (MR) as a compelling medium to support time-critical emergencies, and study its use in this context through an iterative user-centered design process. Our research outlines a number of key considerations for the design of time-critical emergency interfaces that led to the creation of HoloCPR, an MR application providing real-time instructions for resuscitation through a combination of visual and spatial cues. HoloCPR's comparative evaluation during a realistic resuscitation scenario indicates how the use of MR can result in decreased reaction time and increased procedural accuracy.

While the potential of AR for applications such as geo-visualization has been shown using a number of demonstration systems, there are virtually no systems in daily use up to now. This is mainly due to technical reasons. Besides suitable displays, there is a lack of reliable and accurate tracking systems, which are however required for an exact registration of the virtual contents and the real scene. Additionally, there is a lack of experience and tools for the creation of mixed reality applications and often, of intuitive interaction techniques. Especially for applications involving public audience (e.g. exhibitions, museums, public participation), additional requirements apply, such as reliability, robustness, easy adaptation to different users, and the necessity for relatively low operating expenses. In this paper, we introduce the GeoScope, a mixed-reality input\/output device, which addresses those problems, especially for public applications. The GeoScope is mounted at a fixed position and consists of a display, oriented towards the user, and a camera, which points at the surroundings. Just as a telescope, the GeoScope can be turned around two axes, the two angles being captured by measuring devices. Together with the known position, a fast and highly precise tracking of the current view direction is possible, allowing the superposition of the real scene, as delivered by the camera, and virtually generated information.","tags":["information_visualization","myown","augmented_reality"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2682efe96114ec2041b030a8751225a63\/gon","author":["Maho Kawagoe","Mai Otsuki","Fumihisa Shibata","Asako Kimura"],"text":"Sharpen Your Carving Skills in Mixed Reality Space","year":"2016","abstract":"This paper proposes a virtual carving system using ToolDevice in a mixed reality (MR) space.

This paper investigates the impact of incongruencies on the sensation\/perception and cognition layers to provoke breaks in plausibility, and the effects these breaks have on spatial and overall presence as prominent constructs of Virtual Reality (VR). We developed a simulated maintenance application to test virtual electrical devices. Participants performed test operations on these devices in a counterbalanced, randomized 2x2 between-subject design in either VR as congruent, or Augmented Reality (AR) as incongruent on the sensation\/perception layer. Cognitive incongruency was induced by the absence of traceable power outages, decoupling perceived cause and effect after activating potentially defective devices. Our results indicate significant differences in the plausibility ratings between the VR and AR conditions, hence between congruent\/incongruent conditions on the sensation\/perception layer. In addition, spatial presence revealed a comparable interaction pattern with the VR vs AR conditions. Both factors decreased for the AR condition (incongruent sensation\/perception) compared to VR (congruent sensation\/perception) for the congruent cognitive case but increased for the incongruent cognitive case. The results are discussed and put into perspective in the scope of recent theories of MR experiences.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/10049710"},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2ef588401b8fbee5a4da14fcb74ca950d\/mfischbach","author":["Anke Giebler-Schubert","Chris Zimmerer","Thomas Wedler","Martin Fischbach","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"Ein digitales Tabletop-Rollenspiel f\u00fcr Mixed-Reality-Interaktionstechniken","year":"2013","abstract":"Dieser Artikel beschreibt die digitale Umsetzung eines rollenspielbasierten Brettspiels zur Exploration neuer Interaktionstechniken.

We demonstrate how this supports three classes of applications along the mixed-reality continuum: (1) entirely virtual objects, such as furniture with EMS friction when pushed or an EMS-based catapult game. (2) Virtual objects augmented via passive props with EMS-constraints, such as a light control panel made tangible by means of a physical cup or a balance-the-marble game with an actuated tray. (3) Augmented appliances with virtual behaviors, such as a physical thermostat dial with EMS-detents or an escape-room that repurposes lamps as levers with detents.

In addition to the significant performance benefit, our impostors compare favorably against the original mesh representation, as geometric and textural temporal aliasing artifacts are heavily suppressed.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","isbn":"9781450390927","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1145\/3489849.3489865"},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2bb1d7b38a0547e186ca0d9fb680c2910\/aschmidt","author":["Lena T.

Particularly, mixed reality can help project initiators to visualize the planned changes to the city landscape in an easy and understandable way, enabling people to participate in a creative manner. However, this technology is challenging for most project initiators, as it requires an extensive technical and\/or domain experience. Besides that, specialized hardware and experienced staff is required. An easy on-boarding process, which introduces mixed reality step-by-step and offers assistance by external service providers could promote both adoption and usage. In this paper, we present the design process and resulting concept of a configurator for a public participation platform, that aims to guide initiators with different levels of technical knowledge. Besides detailing the design and development process of the prototype, we will present the preliminary results of our evaluation. The interview partners provided positive feedback on the usage of our configurator. Moreover, different approaches are necessary for the public and private sector when configuring and purchasing their participation solution. Finally, we highlight areas that are still in need of further work, such as the compliance with the regulations for public institutions and address further promising areas of research.","tags":["lang:en","myown","aps","ilin"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Springer","isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2b874dd7c2b462642818ef97ea2691120\/dblp","author":["Shahram Izadi"],"text":"The Reality of Mixed Reality.","year":"2016","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"9781450340687","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/sui\/sui2016.html#Izadi16"},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21ebbdf06f89b67cab9850cbf4c7b296c\/dblp","author":["Florian Mueller","Martin R.

We examine two new modalities: gaze input and output in the peripheral field of view. All modalities are considered in the whole spectrum of the mixed-reality continuum. We show the added value of these new forms of multimodal interaction in two important application domains: Automotive User Interfaces and Human-Robot Collaboration. We present experiments that analyze gaze under various conditions and help to design a 3D model for peripheral vision. Furthermore, this work presents several new algorithms for eye-based interaction, like deictic reference in mobile scenarios, for non-intrusive user identification, or exploiting the peripheral field view for advanced multimodal presentations. These algorithms have been integrated into a number of software tools for eye-based interaction, which are used to implement 15 use cases for intelligent environment applications. These use cases cover a wide spectrum of applications, from spatial interactions with a rapidly changing environment from within a moving vehicle, to mixed-reality interaction between teams of human and robots.","tags":["image","zzz.mmi","book","ai","analysis","01801","multimodal","interface","dfki","103","interaction","user","algorithm"],"pub-type":"phdthesis","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d5560a91a852790f0444ecf773a6b057\/slegroux","author":["Ulysses Bernardet","Sergi Bermudez i Badia","Armin Duff","Martin Inderbitzin","Sylvain Le Groux","Jonatas Manzolli","Zenon Mathews","Anna Mura","Aleksander Valjamae","Paul F.

In this paper, we propose a mobile mixed reality guide system for indoor environments, Chloe@University. A mobile computing device (Sony's Ultra Mobile PC) is hidden inside a jacket and a user selects a destination inside a building through voice commands. A 3D virtual assistant then appears in the see-through HMD and guides him\/her to destination. Thus, the user simply follows the virtual guide. Chloe@University also suggests the most suitable virtual character (e.g. human guide, dog, cat, etc.) based on user preferences and profiles. Depending on user profiles, different security levels and authorizations for content are previewed. Concerning indoor location tracking, WiFi, RFID, and sensor-based methods are integrated in this system to have maximum flexibility. Moreover smart and transparent wireless connectivity provides the user terminal with fast and seamless transition among Access Points (APs). Different AR navigation approaches have been studied: Olwal 2006, Elmqvist et al. and Newman et al. work indoors while Bell et al. 2002 and Reitmayr and Drummond 2006 are employed outdoors. Accurate tracking and registration is still an open issue and recently it has mostly been tackled by no single method, but mostly through aggregation of tracking and localization methods, mostly based on handheld AR. A truly wearable, HMD based mobile AR navigation aid for both indoors and outdoors with rich 3D content remains an open issue and a very active field of multi-discipline research.","tags":["coauthor","co-author"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"9781595938633","url":"http:\/\/doi.acm.org\/10.1145\/1315184.1315233"},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2ac36ea34e7460fb52fac2f8004823299\/weibel","author":["Steven Rick","Vish Ramesh","Danilo Gasques Rodrigues","Nadir Weibel"],"text":"Pervasive Sensing in Healthcare: From Observing and Collecting to Seeing and Understanding","year":"2017","abstract":"From analyzing complex socio-technical systems, to evaluating novel interactions, increasingly pervasive sensing technologies provide researchers with new ways to observe the world. This paradigm shift is enabling capture of richer and more diverse data, combining elements from in-depth study of activity and behavior with modern sensors, and providing the means to accelerate sense-making of complex behavioral data. At the same time novel multimodal signal processing and machine learning techniques are equipping us with 'super powers' that enable understanding of these data in real-time, opening up new opportunities for embracing the concept of 'Data Science in the Wild'. In this paper we present what this transition means in the context of Health and Healthcare, focusing on how it leads to the 'UbiScope', a ubiquitous computing microscope for detecting particular health conditions in real-time, promoting reflection on care, and guiding medical practices. Just as the microscope supported key scientific advances, the UbiScope will act as a proxy for understanding and supporting human activity and inform specific interventions in the years ahead.","tags":["myown","weibel"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/218403517bdf42921d9e4d2489337196e\/thiespfeiffer","author":["Thies Pfeiffer","Nikita Mattar"],"text":"Benefits of Locating Overt Visual Attention in Space Using Binocular Eye Tracking for Mixed Reality Applications","year":"2009","abstract":"The \"Where?\" is quite important for Mixed Reality applications: Where is the user looking at?

The high amount of data collected with LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data for realistic rendering and simulation problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to be transformed into representations that fulfill the computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In this tutorial participants will be introduced to state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing and surface reconstruction with open source software to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by interleaved presentations, software demonstrations and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in C\/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes and other meshing methods will play another central role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering, segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface reconstruction will be provided. Participants are invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical problems occuring when working with large scale 3D point clouds in VR and AR applications.","tags":["imported","myown"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21a68f1b27083509fe80254e4dfbbfe8f\/dblp","author":["Martin Faust"],"text":"Mixed reality gaming environment QuakeRunner.","year":"2003","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Carnegie Mellon University","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/iwec\/icec2003.html#Faust03"},{"search_string":"mixed reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21397858024d144fe3d36204527b7dfd5\/dblp","author":["Jarbas J\u00e1come","Maria Oliveira","Fernando Alvim","Veronica Teichrieb","Geber L.

In essence, we are searching for a 3-D user interface metaphor as powerful as the desktop metaphor for 2-D. At the heart of the Studierstube system, collaborative augmented reality is used to embed computer-generated images into the real work environment In the #rst part of this paper, we review the user interface of the initial Studierstube system, in particular the implementation of collaborative augmented reality , and the Personal Interaction Panel, a two-handed interface for interaction with the system. In the second part, an extended Studierstube system based on a heterogeneous distributed architecture is presented. This system allows the user to combine multiple approaches--- augmented reality, projection displays, and ubiquitous computing---to the interface as needed. The environment is controlled by the Personal Interaction Panel, a twohanded, pen-and-pad interface that has versatile uses for interacting with the virtual environment. Studierstube also borrows elements from the desktop, such as multitasking and multi-windowing. The resulting software architecture is a user interface management system for complex augmented reality applications. The presentation is complemented by selected application examples 1","tags":["augmentedreality","mybsc"],"pub-type":"misc","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.12.4351"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2805c23473079b2264db023e35df9c4d4\/ijtsrd","author":["Bharath.

It will present examples of state-of-the-art display configurations, appropriate real-time rendering techniques, details about hardware and software implementations, and current areas of application.

Ray tracing techniques process pixels independently from each other, allowing an easy integration with image-based tracking techniques, contrary to traditional projection-based rasterization graphics systems, e.g. OpenGL. Therefore, by associating our highly optimized ray tracer with an augmented reality framework, the proposed pipeline is capable to provide high quality rendering with real time interaction between virtual and real objects, such as occlusions, soft shadows, custom shaders, reflections and self-reflections, some of these features only available in our rendering pipeline. As proof of concept, we present a case study with the ARToolKitPlus library and the Microsoft Kinect hardware, both integrated in our pipeline. Furthermore, we show the performance and visual results in high definition of the novel pipeline on modern graphics cards, presenting occlusion and recursive reflection effects between virtual and real objects without the latter ones needing to be previously modeled when using Kinect. Furthermore, an adaptive soft shadow sampling algorithm for ray tracing is presented, generating high quality shadows in real time for most scenes.","tags":["augmented_reality","real-time","reflection"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/26f61b93495744226a245fb580b6f6c37\/ijtsrd","author":["R.

Augmented reality allows interaction with virtual objects spatially registered in the user\u2019s real environment, in order to provide information, facilitate collaboration and control machines. As the comput- ing and interaction devices necessary for augmented reality become ubiquitously available, opportunities arise for improved interaction and new applications. Building ubiquitous augmented reality systems presents three software engineering chal- lenges. First, the system must cope with uncertainty regarding the software components; the users\u2019 mobility changes the availability of distributed devices. Second, during development, the system\u2019s desired behavior is ill-defined, as appropriate interaction metaphors are still be- ing researched and users\u2019 preferences change. Third, the system must maintain near-real-time performance to create a convincing user experience. This dissertation presents a new architectural style, the adaptive service dependency architec- ture, to address these challenges. The architecture deals with component uncertainty, using middleware for decentralized ser- vice management to dynamically adapt the system\u2019s structure. It builds on existing architec- tural approaches, such as loosely coupled services, service discovery, reflection, and data flow architectures, but additionally considers the interdependencies between distributed services and uses them for system adaption. With the development technique of design at run time, users and developers address ill- defined requirements by changing the system\u2019s behavior while it is running, facilitating the creation of new applications. This is based on existing agile development methods, but takes additional advantage of the architecture\u2019s adaptive and reflective properties. Distributed middleware maintains the required performance by decoupling multimedia data flow from system reconfiguration. It combines existing communication and service discovery technologies, but additionally deals with the distributed coordination of networks of interde- pendent services. Several prototype systems for real-world ubiquitous augmented reality applications have been built using the adaptive service dependency architecture, decentralized middleware, and design at run time. Feedback from users and developers, as well as performance tests, show the concepts\u2019 usefulness for building ubiquitous augmented reality systems.","tags":["ubiquitouscomputing","tum","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"pub-type":"techreport","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.110.5551"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2b04e9c578ae7e853568878b72523618c\/sdt","author":["L.

Eighteen studies were included during the period 1996 to September 30, 2015.

This is especially important for our application context, which utilizes mobile AR for navigation and other operations in an urban environment. A key problem in the AR field is how to best depict occluded objects in such a way that the viewer can correctly infer the depth relationships between different physical and virtual objects. Showing a single occluded object with no depth context presents an ambiguous picture to the user. But showing all occluded objects in the environments leads to the \u201cSuperman\u2019s X-ray vision \u201d problem, in which the user sees too much information to make sense of the depth relationships of objects. Our efforts differ qualitatively from previous work in AR occlusion, because our application domain involves farfield occluded objects, which are tens of meters distant from the user. Previous work has focused on near-field occluded objects, which are within or just beyond arm\u2019s reach, and which use different perceptual cues. We designed and evaluated a number of sets of display attributes. We then conducted a user study to determine which representations best express occlusion relationships among far-field objects. We identify a drawing style and opacity settings that enable the user to accurately interpret three layers of occluded objects, even in the absence of perspective constraints. 1","tags":["layers","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.110.2753"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/25379b2d1b22404e344a1b6fc32ad2052\/jpmor","author":["Hartmut Seichter","Jens Grubert","Tobias Langlotz"],"text":"Designing mobile augmented reality","year":"2013","abstract":"The development of mobile Augmented Reality application became increasingly popular over the last few years.

Augmented reality (AR) neuronavigation is a significant advance, providing a real-time updated 3D virtual model of anatomical details, overlaid on the real surgical field. Currently, only a few AR systems have been tested in a clinical setting. The aim is to review such devices. We performed a PubMed search of reports restricted to human studies of in vivo applications of AR in any neurosurgical procedure using the search terms Augmented reality and Neurosurgery. Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers in an unblinded standardized manner. The systems were qualitatively evaluated on the basis of the following: neurosurgical subspecialty of application, pathology of treated lesions and lesion locations, real data source, virtual data source, tracking modality, registration technique, visualization processing, display type, and perception location. Eighteen studies were included during the period 1996 to September 30, 2015. The AR systems were grouped by the real data source: microscope (8), hand- or head-held cameras (4), direct patient view (2), endoscope (1), and X-ray fluoroscopy (1) head-mounted display (1). A total of 195 lesions were treated: 75 (38.46 \\%) were neoplastic, 77 (39.48 \\%) neurovascular, and 1 (0.51 \\%) hydrocephalus, and 42 (21.53 \\%) were undetermined. Current literature confirms that AR is a reliable and versatile tool when performing minimally invasive approaches in a wide range of neurosurgical diseases, although prospective randomized studies are not yet available and technical improvements are needed.","tags":["reality","mixed","surgery"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10143-016-0732-9"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2433c7d9ba1e7705315ad68cf0b6c8cce\/rwoz","author":["Oliver Bimber","Ramesh Raskar"],"text":"Modern approaches to augmented reality","year":"2006","abstract":null,"tags":["raskar","realtime","virtual-reality","siggraph","course","camera-projector-systems","augmented-reality","da","bimber"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"1595933646","url":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1185657.1185796&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&CFID=14967832&CFTOKEN=98174926"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2bbdabda524b0adf5569473e4fb7a6d5b\/kw","author":["Ronald Azuma","Yohan Baillot","Steven Feiner"],"text":"Recent Advances in Augmented Reality","year":"2001","abstract":"AR&#039;s growth and prog reg have be1 re1T kable In the late 1990s,se e ral confenffi62 onARbe09I including the Inte national Workshop and Symposium onAugmeI e Re6I93 , the Inte national Symposiumon Mixe Re9797 , and the DeTE30fiz Augme2 e Re0939 Environmez9 workshop.Some we719Ifiz9T organizations forme that focuse on AR, notably the Mixe Re06 ity Systefi Lab in Japan and the Arvika consortium in Ge many.

We examine the problem of accurately placing virtual annotations at physical target points from a static point of view. While it is easy to line up annotations with a target point&#039;s projection in the view plane, finding the correct distance for the annotation is difficult if the target point is not represented in an environment model. We have found that AR depth cues, such as vertical and horizontal shadow planes, a small top-down map, or color encodings of relative depth, have a positive impact on a user&#039;s ability to align a 3D cursor with physical objects at various distances. These cues aid the user&#039;s depth perception and estimation by providing information about the 3D cursor&#039;s distance and its relationship in 3-space to any features that may already have been annotated. We conducted a user study that measures the effects of different depth cues for both absolute 3D cursor placement as well as placement relative to a small number of marked reference points, whose distances are known. Our study provides insight about mobile AR users &#039; ability to judge distances both absolutely and relatively, and we identify techniques that successfully enhance their performance. 1.","tags":["augmentedreality","mybsc"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.157.96"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2eebf4646cee300ba90acc8364574b11f\/flint63","author":["Gregory Kipper","Joseph Rampolla"],"text":"Augmented Reality","year":"2012","abstract":"With the explosive growth in mobile phone usage and rapid rise in search engine technologies over the last decade, augmented reality (AR) is poised to be one of this decade's most disruptive technologies, as the information that is constantly flowing around us is brought into view, in real-time, through augmented reality.

The technology that supports augmented reality will come and go, evolve and change. The underlying principles for creating exciting, useful augmented reality experiences are timeless. Augmented reality designed from a purely technological perspective will lead to an AR experience that is novel and fun for one-time consumption - but is no more than a toy. Imagine a filmmaking book that discussed cameras and special effects software, but ignored cinematography and storytelling! In order to create compelling augmented reality experiences that stand the test of time and cause the participant in the AR experience to focus on the content of the experience - rather than the technology - one must consider how to maximally exploit the affordances of the medium. This book addresses core conceptual issues regarding the medium of augmented reality as well as the technology required to support compelling augmented reality. By addressing AR as a medium at the conceptual level in addition to the technological level, the reader will learn to conceive of AR applications that are not limited by today's technology. At the same time, ample examples are provided that show what is possible with current technology.","tags":["zzz.mmi","elsevier","development","book","ai","graphics","acm","application","multimodal","01624","interface","3d","103","design","interaction","user","embedded"],"pub-type":"book","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","isbn":"9780240824086","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/book\/9780240824086"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20680c88d553e883a39b30b3e17f1a870\/kw","author":["S.K.

We believe there is a need for an unconstrained, infrastructureindependent AR display running to fill the gap in situations where traditional backpack systems are too costly and cumbersome, but thin client implementations exhibit inadequate deployability, scalability or interactive behavior. Particular examples include sporadic use over lengthy time spans, in between which devices must be stowed away, mixed indoor\/outdoor use in wide-area environments, and massively multi-user application scenarios. This has motivated us to develop a state of the art AR framework targeting lightweight handheld displays.","tags":["mobilecomputing","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27840554ecde82b7a9d33815cebb28f77\/sdt","author":["M.

The first prototype operated at 16 frames per second, whereas the second, improved version had 20 frames per second. In addition, the hand-eye coordination while wearing the welding helmet with video see-through head-mounted display was compared to a performance with natural vision, without any helmet. Experimental results showed significant influence of helmet and occupation on hand-eye coordination. Subjective assessment revealed better rating for stereo perception for the system with the higher frame rate, whereas no significant difference in performance was found between the two frame rates.","tags":["Augmented_Reality","Hand-eye-coordination","Welding","Video_See-through_HMD","mmspub"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2fb17a96645fc709ce6db2e239c1573b4\/sdt","author":["L.

Thus accurate volume estimation is required for accurate nutrition information assessment. This work presents an evaluation of our mobile augmented reality approaches for portion estimation and offers a comparison to conventional portion estimation approaches. The comparison is performed on the basis of a user study (n=28). The quality of nutrition assessment is measured based on the error in energy units. In the results of the evaluation one of our mobile augmented reality approaches significantly outperforms all other methods.

Nowadays embedding advertisements, or incorporating text and graphics in TV scenes, are common practice, but they can not be considered as integrated part of the scene. The introduction of new services for interactive augmented television is discussed in this paper. We analyse the main aspects related with the whole chain of augmented reality production. Interactivity is one of the most important added values of the digital television: This paper aims to break the model where all TV viewers receive the same final image. Thus, we introduce and discuss the new concept of interactive augmented television, i. e. real time composition of video and computer graphics - e.g. a real scene and freely selectable images or spatial rendered objects - edited and customized by the end user within the context of the user's set top box and TV receiver. We demonstrate a sample application introducing \"Interactive Augmented Television\" for sport broadcasts additionally with 3D virtual objects in order to enhance or alter the presentation of the match with a new interface. We also introduce a pure virtual world where the user can select the camera position.","tags":["[OMK06]","EuroITV2006","DiPP","Interactive_Television","Digital_Video_Broadcasting","Customization","Open_Access","ITV","DVB","Journal_of_Virtual_Reality_and_Broadcasting","AR","Augmented_Reality","Multimedia_Home_Platform","Virtual_Reality","MHP","Peer_Reviewed","Interactive_TV","3.2006","JVRB","VR","User_Interfaces","Digital_Peer_Publishing_Initiative","3(2006)13"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"urn:nbn:de:0009-6-7863"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2700a67e6692441bf60a77d1d8980467e\/hci-uwb","author":["Doris Aschenbrenner","Michael Rojkov","Florian Leutert","Jouke Verlinden","Stephan Lukosch","Marc Erich Latoschik","Klaus Schilling"],"text":"Comparing Different Augmented Reality Support Applications for Cooperative Repair of an Industrial Robot","year":"2018","abstract":"Digitization and the growing capabilities of data networks enable companies to perform tasks via remote support, which previously required service personnel to travel.

Through the distributed shared scene graph mechanism, consistency of scene graph replicas and the contained application nodes is assured.

This paper provides a classification of existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.","tags":["augmented_reality","visualization"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s40537-015-0031-2"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/29e809bf14ab1297297a005ccc8dabf29\/thesaiorg","author":["Haui-Chih Shiau Chouyin Hsu"],"text":"The Visual Web User Interface Design in Augmented Reality Technology","year":"2013","abstract":"Upon the popularity of 3C devices, the visual creatures are all around us, such the online game, touch pad, video and animation.

With the popularity of webcam, digital camera, stereoscopic glasses, or head-mounted display, the user interface becomes more visual and multi-dimensional. For the consideration of 3D and visual display in the research of web user interface design, Augmented Reality technology providing the convenient tools and impressive effects becomes the hot topic. Augmented Reality effect enables users to represent parts of the digital objects on top of the physical surroundings. The easy operation with webcam greatly improving the visual representation of web pages becomes the interest of our research. Therefore, we apply Augmented Reality technology for developing a city tour web site to collect the opinions of users. Therefore, the website stickiness is an important measurement. The major tasks of the work include the exploration of Augmented Reality technology and the evaluation of the outputs of Augmented Reality. The feedback opinions of users are valuable references for improving AR application in the work. As a result, the AR increasing the visual and interactive effects of web page encourages users to stay longer and more than 80\\% of users are willing to return for visiting the website soon.

Our Ubiquitous Tracking (Ubitrack) approach seeks to overcome this limitation, not by extending the range of a single tracker, but by dynamically incorporating a number of heterogeneous sensors. The Ubitrack tool set consists of Spatial Relationship Graphs (SRGs), which allow for a formal specification of tracking environments, and Spatial Relationship Patterns, which are used to derive data flow configurations by systematic analysis of the SRG. This formal framework supports a distributed software architecture, where clients efficiently produce, transform, transmit and consume tracking data, coordinated by a Ubitrack server.

Researchers have solved many technical challenges during that time, finally allowing practical access to this user interface. While early AR research focused on head-mounted displays and backpack computers, it now encompasses a variety of enabling technologies, including camera phones and other handhelds, advanced projector-camera systems, and AR-extended professional devices, such as x-ray scanners. It is this evolution that has finally made it possible to use AR in our daily lives. Although AR's practical applications have not yet reached the level that many people involved in the field have dreamed of, the number of these applications is steadily increasing. Beyond what has been published about AR in the scientific literature and the lay press, current research in the field poses some exciting questions: What's real about augmented reality? What role does it play for all of us today, and what impact will it potentially have on society in the future? Will there be a killer app for AR, or will the AR bubble finally burst?

Moreover, in the Geosciences the GPS positioning is relevant to the data acquisition as well as to the planning of the fieldwork. Nowadays, mobile devices are widespread, constituting an accessible platform consisting of single devices coupled with different sensors for data acquisition, such as GPS, compass, magnetometer, etc. Emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) enable the use of these devices as a software platform to complement the perception of our surrounding environment. Despite the fact that there are several AR applications focused on different aspects of Geosciences, a comprehensive fieldwork oriented system, which can be easily adapted to the community needs, is still missing. Based on a multidisciplinary work between professionals from Geosciences and Computer Sciences, we designed and developed a framework based AR system named ARGeo. The proposed system constitutes a complementing tool for the geologist's fieldwork carefully designed to be used in remote sites, using only the mobile device hardware and without the need of an internet connection for data acquisition. ARGeo complements the fieldwork observation and the precise recording of geological data needed, e.g., for the interpretation of folded structures. It allows the user to register geo-tagged information such as points of interests (i.e. references on the field or the fold itself) using natural interactions. In addition, it provides two novel features: an interactive dipping plane measurement from distant points of view and a back-in-time visualization of previous recorded positions, in order to help understanding the spatial relations among the recorded samples. Pilot studies were conducted with domain experts of geology and they agree on the potential of the system. Results point out that ARGeo naturally integrates mobile devices and AR to the geologists' fieldwork. Its possible extension with new features to the Geosciences as well as to other application fields is detailed.","tags":["AR","geoscience","fieldwork"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0098300417313237"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/23f92f4c1259eb58a639b768cf4e84501\/fprager","author":["Wolfgang H\u00fcrst","Casper van Wezel"],"text":"Multimodal Interaction Concepts for Mobile Augmented Reality Applications","year":"2011","abstract":"Augmented reality on mobile phones \u2013 i.e. applications where users look at the live image of the device\u2019s video camera and the scene that they see is enriched by 3D virtual objects \u2013 provides great potential in areas such as cultural heritage, entertainment, and tourism.

However, the methodological heterogeneity of previous research has made it difficult to assess the suitability of different MR systems for therapeutic use in these areas. The effects of MR system properties and related psychometric factors on body-related perceptions have so far remained unclear. We developed an interactive virtual mirror embodiment application to investigate the differences between an augmented reality see-through head-mounted-display (HMD) and a virtual reality HMD on the before-mentioned factors. Additionally, we considered the influence of the participant's body-mass-index (BMI) and the BMI difference between participants and their avatars on the estimations. The 54 normal-weight female participants significantly underestimated the weight of their photorealistic, generic avatar in both conditions. Body weight estimations were significantly predicted by the participants' BMI and the BMI difference. We also observed partially significant differences in presence and tendencies for differences in virtual body ownership between the systems. Our results offer new insights into the relationships of body weight perception in different MR environments and provide new perspectives for the development of therapeutic applications.","tags":["myown","vitras"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2020-ismar-body-weight-perception-vr-ar-preprint.pdf"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/25e5c3e101ed10c7cafc2cd44e561c482\/gridinoc","author":["B.

Based on this finding, approaches to support the therapy of body perception disturbances in eating or body weight disorders by mixed reality (MR) systems gain in importance. However, the methodological heterogeneity of previous research has made it difficult to assess the suitability of different MR systems for therapeutic use in these areas. The effects of MR system properties and related psychometric factors on body-related perceptions have so far remained unclear. We developed an interactive virtual mirror embodiment application to investigate the differences between an augmented reality see-through head-mounted-display (HMD) and a virtual reality HMD on the before-mentioned factors. Additionally, we considered the influence of the participant's body-mass-index (BMI) and the BMI difference between participants and their avatars on the estimations. The 54 normal-weight female participants significantly underestimated the weight of their photorealistic, generic avatar in both conditions. Body weight estimations were significantly predicted by the participants' BMI and the BMI difference. We also observed partially significant differences in presence and tendencies for differences in virtual body ownership between the systems. Our results offer new insights into the relationships of body weight perception in different MR environments and provide new perspectives for the development of therapeutic applications.","tags":["ewolf","myown","emlab","vitras","dmal"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2020-ismar-body-weight-perception-vr-ar-preprint.pdf"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d179f74ea64a5e31ac466217050fe528\/kw","author":["Kurt Squire","Mingfong Jan"],"text":"Mad City Mystery: Developing Scientific Argumentation Skills with a Place-based Augmented Reality Game on Handheld Computers","year":"2007","abstract":"While the knowledge economy has reshaped the world, schools lag behind in producing appropriate learning for this social change. Science education needs to prepare students for a future world in which multiple representations are the norm and adults are required to think like scientists. Location-based augmented reality games offer an opportunity to create a post-progressive pedagogy in which students are not only immersed in authentic scientific inquiry, but also required to perform in adult scientific discourses. This cross-case comparison as a component of a design-based research study investigates three cases (roughly 28 students total) where an Augmented Reality curriculum, Mad City Mystery, was used to support learning in environmental science. We investigate whether augmented reality games on handhelds can be used to engage students in scientific thinking (particularly argumentation), how game structures affect students\u2019 thinking, the impact of role playing on learning, and the role of the physical environment in shaping learning. We argue that such games hold potential for engaging students in meaningful scientific argumentation. Through game play, players are required to develop narrative accounts of scientific phenomena, a process that requires them to develop and argue scientific explanations. We argue that specific game features scaffold this thinking process, creating supports for student thinking non-existent in most inquiry-based learning environments.","tags":["mybsccandid","games","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10956-006-9037-z"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2440c9a7329063c35172f42d8703e228b\/maggie2008","author":["E.

The addition of haptic (force and\/or tactile) feedback has been proposed as a way to further enhance the performance of these systems. However, due to limitations in sensing and control technologies, implementing direct haptic feedback to the surgeon's hands remains impractical for clinical application. A new, intuitive augmented reality system for presentation of force information through sensory substitution has been developed and evaluated. The augmented reality system consists of force-sensing robotic instruments, a kinematic tool tracker, and a graphic display that overlays a visual representation of force levels on top of the moving instrument tips. The system is integrated with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) and tested by several users in a phantom knot tying task. The augmented reality system decreases the number of broken sutures, decreases the number of loose knots, and results in more consistent application of forces.","tags":["imported"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/26c23c04054eff1cf05200200b969cbaf\/dblp","author":["Thomas Tamisier","Irene M.

In addition, two other kinds of assembly support media (a paper manual and a tutorial by an expert) were examined in order to compare them with ARsembly. The results showed that the assembly times varied according to the different support conditions. AR-support proved to be more suitable for difficult tasks than the paper manual, whereas for easier tasks, the use of a paper manual did not differ significantly from AR-support. Tasks done under the guidance of an expert, were completed most rapidly.

In this paper we address this problem by conducting an experiment with 142 subjects in three different industries: aviation, medical, and space. We evaluate whether the Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality head-mounted display, causes simulator sickness and how different symptom groups contribute to it (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation).

The purpose of this research is to investigate the fundamental distinctions between AR and VR in the context of course instruction. Educators can acquire insights into how these technologies might be effectively integrated into the classroom by evaluating their specific traits, affordances, and limits. The research begins by defining AR and VR and then compares their key ideas. AR superimposes digital information on the real-world environment to improve the user's impression of reality, whereas VR immerses users in a simulated environment to create a sensation of presence and immersion. These contrasts lay the groundwork for comprehending their disparate uses in education. The study then goes into the educational benefits and difficulties of AR and VR. AR allows students to interact with digital information in real time, encouraging engagement, collaboration, and contextualized learning. It could bridge the gap between abstract ideas and real-world applications. VR, on the other hand, provides an immersive and regulated environment that allows students to explore complicated scenarios, imitate real-world circumstances, and acquire important skills in a safe and cost-effective manner. The research looks at the technology needs, accessibility concerns, and implementation techniques for AR and VR in educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of pedagogical design, content creation, and teacher training to maximize these technologies' educational impact. This review paper investigates the differences between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in the context of course education. AR and VR have emerged as significant tools for boosting the learning experience as technology continues to alter education. Understanding the distinct characteristics and benefits of each technology is critical for educators to make educated judgments about how to include them in their teaching practices. This paper examines AR and VR in depth, concentrating on their distinctions, uses, and possible influence in educational contexts.","tags":["Augmented","education,","Reality,","developing","Virtual","technologies,"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/journals.researchparks.org\/index.php\/IJOT\/article\/view\/4646\/4339"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2e5a3f3f4b387f704c3e19066842ab65b\/dblp","author":["Hongen Liao"],"text":"3D Medical Imaging and Augmented Reality for Image-Guided Surgery.","year":"2011","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"Springer","isbn":"9781461400639","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/books\/daglib\/0027797.html#Liao11"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2c08b3ee6daeae095645af24c1033e06d\/dblp","author":["Wendy E.

These synthetic receptors offer complimentary information on our surroundings and endow us with novel means of manipulating physical or even virtual objects. We realize highly compliant magnetosensitive skins with directional perception that enable magnetic cognition, body position tracking, and touchless object manipulation. Transfer printing of eight high-performance spin valve sensors arranged into two Wheatstone bridges onto 1.7-\u03bcm-thick polyimide foils ensures mechanical imperceptibility. This resembles a new class of interactive devices extracting information from the surroundings through magnetic tags. We demonstrate this concept in augmented reality systems with virtual knob-turning functions and the operation of virtual dialing pads, based on the interaction with magnetic fields.

Analysis of teacher\u2013child dialogue in a comparative study between use of an AR virtual mirror interface and more traditional science teaching methods for 10-year-old children, revealed that the children using AR were less engaged than those using traditional resources. We suggest four design requirements that need to be considered if AR is to be successfully adopted into classroom practice. These requirements are: flexible content that teachers can adapt to the needs of their children, guided exploration so learning opportunities can be maximised, in a limited time, and attention to the needs of institutional and curricular requirements.","tags":["augmentedreality","mybsc"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":"Springer London","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10055-006-0036-4"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2caa81047e3816c5ae7cbca85291274bd\/felixl7","author":["Arindam Dey","Graeme Jarvis","Christian Sandor","Gerhard Reitmayr"],"text":"Tablet Versus Phone: Depth Perception in Handheld Augmented Reality","year":"2012","abstract":null,"tags":["Handheld_Displays","Visualization","Estimation","User_Evaluation","Augmented_Reality","X-ray_Visualization","Mobile_handsets","Cameras","Depth_Perception","Mobile_communication","Outdoor_Environment","Target_tracking"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","isbn":"9781467346603","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/ISMAR.2012.6402556"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27f16523a702db52a2717dfdd1bca6665\/jpmor","author":["Shafaq Irshad","Dayang Rohaya Bt Awang Rambli"],"text":"User Experience of Mobile Augmented Eeality: A Review of Studies","year":"2014","abstract":"Augmented Reality is an advance technology that enhances the real world by overlaying digital data on top of it.

Indeed, a review of currently available mobile AR apps suggests that they are embracing practical uses instead of simply showing off the capabilities of AR. Many of these apps are making information more ubiquitous without making the user necessarily aware of the data's origins, using graphics to represent multiple datasets. There has been however little research focusing on the trends in AR and the types of data visualisations used in mobile AR. The purpose of this paper is to fill that void by presenting an analysis of currently popular mobile AR apps on the market. Our findings from this small-scale investigation give an indication of the types of visualisation styles used in current mobile AR apps and highlight suggestions for how to make the information presented more relevant, for example by using better filtering methods.","tags":["tablet","trend"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"9781450327657","url":"http:\/\/doi.acm.org\/10.1145\/2636240.2636864"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2dcba184a218908f861274ba65f1d3ff0\/dblp","author":["Andrea Manno-Kovacs","Csaba Benedek","Levente Kov\u00e1cs"],"text":"Content-Based Analysis of Medical Image Data for Augmented Reality Based Health Applications.","year":"2019","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/ercim\/ercim2019.html#Manno-KovacsBK19"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2de9fd0a55d9182d9dd1fcad1ce54c24d\/sdt","author":["O.

Shapes can be automatically assigned virtual content by classification according to a shape class library. Nestor performs shape recognition by analyzing contour structures and generating projective-invariant signatures from their concavities.

Pose refinement is carried out by minimizing the reprojection error between sample points on each image contour and its library counterpart.

This cross-case comparison as a component of a design-based research study investigates three cases (roughly 28 students total) where an Augmented Reality curriculum, Mad City Mystery, was used to support learning in environmental science. We investigate whether augmented reality games on handhelds can be used to engage students in scientific thinking (particularly argumentation), how game structures affect students' thinking, the impact of role playing on learning, and the role of the physical environment in shaping learning. We argue that such games hold potential for engaging students in meaningful scientific argumentation. Through game play, players are required to develop narrative accounts of scientific phenomena, a process that requires them to develop and argue scientific explanations. We argue that specific game features scaffold this thinking process, creating supports for student thinking non-existent in most inquiry-based learning environments.","tags":["imported","thesis"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2f5a6e3aa7326ed2ccbaa2bbb6f4bf8b6\/oberdoerfer","author":["Lucas Plabst","Aditya Raikwar","Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","Francisco Raul Ortega","Florian Niebling"],"text":"Exploring Unimodal Notification Interaction and Display Methods in Augmented Reality","year":"2023","abstract":"As we develop computing platforms for augmented reality (AR) head-mounted display (HMDs) technologies for social or workplace environments, understanding how users interact with notifications in immersive environments has become crucial.

Like tropical coral reefs, these habitats are subject to climate and anthropogenic threats. The use of remotely operated vehicles (ROVSs) in combination with three-dimensional (3D) modelling and augmented reality (AR) has enabled detailed visualisation of terrestrial and marine environments while promoting data accessibility and scientific outreach. However, remote environments such as CWC reefs still present challenges with data acquisition, which impacts the further understanding of these environments. This study aims to develop a mobile application using structure-from-motion (SfM) 3D photogrammetric data and AR for the visualisation of CWC reefs. The mobile application was developed to display 3D models of CWC reefs from the Piddington Mound area, southwest of Ireland. The 3D models were tested at different resolutions to analyse the visualisation experience and trade-off between resolution and application size. The results from the 3D reconstructions with higher resolution indicate that the combination of SfM, AR, and mobile phones is a promising tool for raising awareness and literacy regarding CWC and deep-water habitats. This study is the first of its kind to showcase CWC habitats accessible to anyone, anywhere with a mobile phone and internet connectivity.","tags":["AR","geoscience"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3263\/12\/10\/356"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/29cd4688b7a3abd98ff1d77295ce119b1\/hanappe","author":["J.

Our approach replaces complex objects by impostors, light-weight image-based representations leveraging geometry and shading related processing costs. In contrast to their classical implementation, our impostors are specifically designed to work in Virtual-, Augmented- and Mixed Reality scenarios (XR for short), as they support stereoscopic rendering to provide correct depth perception. Motion parallax of typical head movements is compensated by using a ray marched parallax correction step. Our approach provides a dynamic run-time recreation of impostors as necessary for larger changes in view position. The dynamic run-time recreation is decoupled from the actual rendering process. Hence, its associated processing cost is therefore distributed over multiple frames.

Our approach replaces complex objects by impostors, light-weight image-based representations leveraging geometry and shading related processing costs. In contrast to their classical implementation, our impostors are specifically designed to work in Virtual-, Augmented- and Mixed Reality scenarios (XR for short), as they support stereoscopic rendering to provide correct depth perception. Motion parallax of typical head movements is compensated by using a ray marched parallax correction step. Our approach provides a dynamic run-time recreation of impostors as necessary for larger changes in view position. The dynamic run-time recreation is decoupled from the actual rendering process. Hence, its associated processing cost is therefore distributed over multiple frames. This avoids any unwanted frame drops or latency spikes even for impostors of objects with complex geometry and many polygons. In addition to the significant performance benefit, our impostors compare favorably against the original mesh representation, as geometric and textural temporal aliasing artifacts are heavily suppressed.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","isbn":"9781450390927","url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1145\/3489849.3489865"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/26ac0ae6af1fcfdface2f4d2167676106\/oberdoerfer","author":["Philipp Schaper","Anna Riedmann","Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","Birgit Lugrin"],"text":"Addressing Waste Separation With a Persuasive Augmented Reality App","year":"2022","abstract":"Separating and recycling waste is an important topic to protect our environment and achieve a more sustainable future. However, recycling also is a complex process, as each type of waste needs a specific recycling method. This comes along with multiple recycling containers, each relevant for one specific type of waste. Ensuring a correct recycling process therefore not only requires specific infrastructure, but also a respective attitude and knowledge of the population. Stressing the need for an accessible educational opportunity addressing waste separation, we present a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application that guides a user through a recycling process and hence scaffolds the learning of proper recycling of each type of waste. The app further provides a prototypical implementation of a product scanner, that identifies the waste type based on a marker and assists the recycling on a case-by-case decision. Using self-determination theory as a framework, we integrated gamification elements, aiming for enhanced need satisfaction, motivation and user experience. In a user study, we compared the gamified version to a control version, with both app versions yielding a high acceptance, user experience, and waste separation behavior. This indicates the importance of providing easy-to-use mobile apps allowing for a learning and assistance of proper recycling.","tags":["oberdoerfer","myown"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/downloads.hci.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de\/2022-addressing-waste-separation-preprint.pdf"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2841858b06919613d7ed9a0b47208e02f\/dblp","author":["John R.

We propose a novel out of sight body-locked text placement for AR text presentation to be used in dual-task situations and compare it to head-locked text placement, each in two heights. AR reading affected performance in all tasks and reading speed was affected in all dual-task conditions. Participants subjectively preferred the body-locked text presentation, while objective measures do not reflect that preference. Differences between the tasks and several interaction effects between task and AR text placement demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the context of use when designing AR reading UIs.

To integrate AR in the everyday classroom, teachers need to be capable of designing their own immersive experiences for their students, which is why an analysis of existing authoring toolkits is necessary to identify suitable tools for educational application development and future research directions in terms of educational AR. We identified \u201ceasy access\u201d, \u201cGUI-based design\u201d, and \u201cinteractive contents\u201d as needs of teachers for designing AR content for the classroom. Based on these needs, we conducted a literature review of 835 documents. Of 80 relevant articles, we included 43 peer-reviewed articles from ACM Digital Library, DBLP, IEEExplore, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and miscellaneous other sources in our analysis. We identified 69 different AR authoring toolkits and classified these with regard to their accessibility, their degree of required programming knowledge, and their interactivity. The results show a divergent research landscape with a lack of empirical evaluation. Of 26 openly accessible toolkits, we identified five toolkits addressing the defined needs of teachers for designing interactive AR experiences for the classroom without requiring extensive programming knowledge. We conclude that there are only few tools for the straightforward design of educational AR experiences addressing the needs of teachers and suggest using research-informed and evidence-based criteria for developing AR authoring toolkits for education.","tags":["grafe"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2a3bc70b5ffe4283222dc509279822e45\/jenniferhaefner","author":["Thomas Olsson","Tuula K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen","Else Lagerstam","Leena Vent\u00e4-Olkkonen"],"text":"User evaluation of mobile augmented reality scenarios.","year":"2012","abstract":null,"tags":["augmentedReality","userStudies","example"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/jaise\/jaise4.html#OlssonKLV12"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20b4e210053918922bbcc3b076a2c4ca2\/oberdoerfer","author":["Kristina Bucher","Sebastian Oberd\u00f6rfer","Silke Grafe","Marc Erich Latoschik"],"text":"Von Medienbeitr\u00e4gen und Applikationen - ein interdisziplin\u00e4res Konzept zum Lehren und Lernen mit Augmented und Virtual Reality f\u00fcr die Hochschullehre","year":"2020","abstract":"Augmented Reality (AR) und Virtual Reality (VR) finden zunehmend Eingang in die Bildungspraxis.

We conducted a pilot study and tested three different versions of directional cues presented while walking or standing still: simply popping up, moving towards the indicated direction, or changing color. The results indicated that the perception of peripheral cues in AR is generally less efficient while walking than standing still. Within the walking condition, the color-changing cue was perceived best.","tags":["itegpub","mmspub"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"GfA-Press","isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22f2caa5d43b21bb9ef4ab717209fef7e\/dblp","author":["Benjamin Bayart"],"text":"R\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e haptique: th\u00e9orie et applications.

Bzgl. Gebrauchstauglichkeit und Beanspruchung deuten sich die St\u00e4rken des AR-Ansatzes an. In den Subskalen Anstrengung und Frustration zeigt sich eine statistisch signifikante Reduktion der Beanspruchung.

A generic framework is proposed which can generate, manage and reduce sensory conflicts at hand level while providing a continuous interaction cycle. Technically, the system is based on a video see-through head-mounted display that allows for embedding the real hand into a virtual scene and to visually manipulate its position in 3D. Two novel methods are introduced on top of this basis: an intuitive virtual object touching paradigm and a hand-displacement-based active pseudo-haptics technique. Both approaches are studied with respect to their benefits, limitations, effects on the behaviour of the user and consequences for the design of Virtual Environments. It is demonstrated that new forms of human-computer interaction are possible exploiting the described visuomotor conflicts of the hand. Promising future perspectives are presented.","tags":["3D","Augmented","User","Interaction","Conflicts","Visuo-Proprioceptive","Hand","Reality"],"pub-type":"phdthesis","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.uni-wuerzburg.de\/fileadmin\/10030030\/publications\/2008_PhD_thesis_Visuo-Proprioceptive_Conflicts_of_the_Hand_for_3D_User_Interaction_in_Augmented_Reality.pdf"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d62f6d7ab92866290b951df96d7be637\/jennifertiede","author":["Jennifer Tiede","Eleni Mangina","Silke Grafe"],"text":"Evaluation Design Methodology for Piloting Two Educational Augmented Reality STEM Apps in European Elementary Schools","year":"2021","abstract":"According to research findings, Augmented Reality (AR) can have a positive impact on student STEM learning and knowledge acquisition.

In the study, an international sample of 1988 primary school students and 91 teachers used an AR-enhanced gamified STEM learning app (intervention group) or traditional teaching and learning approaches (control group). Student motivation and performance were assessed in a pre and post test design and teachers\u2019 opinions were recorded using online surveys. The results indicate that students and teachers in the intervention group considered the motivational impact of the AR-enhanced gamified app significantly higher, compared to the ratings for alternative media in the control group. The product-moment correlation between motivation and further variables, such as student attitudes and self-efficacy, showed significant, medium strong results which are comparably high in intervention and control group. Only in the intervention group, motivation and learning achievement were correlated. Students and teachers in the intervention group tended to agree on the motivational impact of the study phase while a correlation between the opinions of teachers and students in the control group could not be confirmed. Overall, the study provides evidence of the pedagogical usefulness of AR-enhanced gamified STEM learning applications in terms of supporting student motivation, based on findings from a large international sample.","tags":["Tiede","Grafe","ARETE"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d62f6d7ab92866290b951df96d7be637\/sp-jmu","author":["Jennifer Tiede","Eleni Mangina","Silke Grafe"],"text":"Evaluation Design Methodology for Piloting Two Educational Augmented Reality STEM Apps in European Elementary Schools","year":"2021","abstract":"According to research findings, Augmented Reality (AR) can have a positive impact on student STEM learning and knowledge acquisition.

Yet, few studies systematically analysed teachers\u2019 opinions and experiences about the advantages and problems in the educational use of AR technologies so far. In response to this desideratum, the following paper presents results from a systematic and category-based qualitative content analysis based on an interview study. The input was collected from a heterogeneous and international convenience sample of n=11 teachers after they had piloted one out of three AR-enhanced learning apps in their daily classroom practice. The results confirm that increased student motivation and classroom engagement and advanced learning achievements are considered the predominant advantages and that issues with software and technology were perceived as the biggest problems in the pilot study. Furthermore, dimensions of motivation and classroom engagement are considered in detail to achieve an in-depth analysis and to bring forward important recommendations for further developments and for teachers\u2019 future educational use of AR technologies.","tags":["Tiede","F\u00f6rster","Grafe","ARETE"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/369571396_AUGMENTED_REALITY_IN_PRIMARY_EDUCATION_TEACHERS'_PERSPECTIVES_ON_POTENTIAL_AND_BARRIERS"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/222411fb3d375990d4c5e53774c1f387c\/gregor","author":["Oliver Bimber","Ramesh Raskar"],"text":"Spatial augmented reality","year":"2005","abstract":null,"tags":["Computergraphik","Erweiterte","Realit{\\\"a}t","Virtuelle"],"pub-type":"book","publisher":"A K Peters","isbn":"1568812302","url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2466d9d3524b5de3aa8d9375a95fc0bad\/dblp","author":["Jason Wither","Yun-Ta Tsai","Ronald Azuma"],"text":"Indirect augmented reality.","year":"2011","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/journals\/cg\/cg35.html#WitherTA11"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20e3ac4310a0b5a6f98532e5341a966a2\/dblp","author":["Mona Singh","Munindar P.

Using several fixed cameras reduces the registration issues and, depending on their location, the workspace could also be enlarged. In this case of an extended workspace, it has been shown that third-person perspective (3PP) is sometimes preferred by the user. Based on the previous hypotheses, we developed a system working with several fixed cameras that can provide 3PP to a user wearing a video see-through HMD.

For our OST AR system, a total of 27 normal-weight female participants provided predominantly positive feedback on display properties (field of view, luminosity, and transparency of virtual objects), body tracking, and the perception of the avatar\u2019s appearance and movements.

Indeed, everyday walking in complex environments utilizes executive function, dual tasking, planning and scanning, all while walking forward. Pilot studies suggest that a multi-modal intervention that combines treadmill training to target motor function and a virtual reality obstacle course to address the cognitive components of fall risk may be used to successfully address the motor-cognitive interactions that are fundamental for fall risk reduction. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on fall risk.","tags":["read","excluded","vr","scholar"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2377-13-15"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/25cadf4e538788ecc4e29d3b5e517e564\/dblp","author":["Kiron Lebeck","Kimberly Ruth","Tadayoshi Kohno","Franziska Roesner"],"text":"Securing Augmented Reality Output.","year":"2017","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","isbn":"9781509055333","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/sp\/sp2017.html#LebeckRKR17"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/258ab1ba3cfc32bc700ad1ad37124a35b\/dblp","author":["Daniel Dobler","Michael Haller","Philipp Stampfl"],"text":"ASR: augmented sound reality.","year":"2002","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/siggraph\/siggraph2002aa.html#DoblerHS02"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20da1c387d4bba8502901630f4e0ee0e6\/dblp","author":["Claudio Kirner","Rafael Santin","Tereza G.

Exact measurements can be tedious, leading most patients to estimate their carbohydrate intake. In the presented pilot study a smartphone application (BEAR), that guides the estimation of the amounts of carbohydrates, was used by a group of diabetic patients. Methods: Eight adult patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 were recruited for the study. At the beginning of the study patients were introduced to BEAR in sessions lasting 45 minutes per patient. Patients redraw the real food in 3D on the smartphone screen. Based on a selected food type and the 3D form created using BEAR an estimation of carbohydrate content is calculated. Patients were supplied with the application on their personal smartphone or a loaner device and were instructed to use the application in real-world context during the study period. For evaluation purpose a test measuring carbohydrate estimation quality was designed and performed at the beginning and the end of the study. Results: In 44% of the estimations performed at the end of the study the error reduced by at least 6 grams of carbohydrate. This improvement occurred albeit several problems with the usage of BEAR were reported. Conclusions: Despite user interaction problems in this group of patients the provided intervention resulted in a reduction in the absolute error of carbohydrate estimation. Intervention with smartphone applications to assist carbohydrate counting apparently results in more accurate estimations.","tags":["AR","myown","diabetes_education","carbohydrate_counting","augmented_reality","mHealth","eHealth"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/1932296815578880"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/263ecc99a6868316efa0970a574bc68dc\/kw","author":["Damon Shing-Min Liu","Chun-Hao Yung","Cheng-Hsuan Chung"],"text":"A Cross-Platform Framework for Physics-Based Collaborative Augmented Reality.","year":"2010","abstract":null,"tags":["collaboration","augmentedreality","mybsc"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"Springer","isbn":"9783642135439","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/sg\/sg2010.html#LiuYC10"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/209cd4dcd605deba1ecef04517be7bde2\/kw","author":["T.

The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and wordgesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.","tags":["myown"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"https:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/document\/10049665\/"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22cc7a67cabe98d8155cd12287d61c728\/dblp","author":["Noureddine Elmqaddem"],"text":"Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in Education.

During the first experiment 15 camera positions with five levels of height displacement and three levels of depth displacement were compared in four different tasks. Using a two-way ANOVA the comparison of the calculated performance characteristic values showed significant influence of height displacement on hand-eye coordination. In conclusion cameras should be placed above or below eye level, but by no more than 35 mm, in order to preserve hand-eye coordination. In the second experiment, a mirror system was used to check hand-eye coordination in an exemplary medical task allowing the cameras to be placed virtually at eye level. A significant decrease in accuracy was found while using the head-mounted display compared to direct view. Finally, the mirror system was compared to the 15 camera positions using the data from the same tasks. Significant differences in performance were found between the mirror system and eye level position as well as the position slightly below eye level. The results of the experiment provide design recommendations for developers and users of video see-through systems.","tags":["Augmented_Reality","Hand-eye_Coordination","Video_see-through","itegpub","mmspub"],"pub-type":"article","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.bentham-open.org\/pages\/gen.php?file=46TOERGJ.pdf"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22b1d92f0e77ba79e0dd5dc6729979f87\/dblp","author":["Oliver Bimber","Ramesh Raskar"],"text":"Modern approaches to augmented reality.","year":"2005","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/siggraph\/siggraph2005courses.html#BimberR05"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20e05f612e039761e8c33e572a923238d\/dblp","author":["Matt Adcock","Matthew A.

The high amount of data collected with LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data for realistic rendering and simulation problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to be transformed into representations that fulfill the computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In this tutorial participants will be introduced to state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing and surface reconstruction with open source software to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by interleaved presentations, software demonstrations and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in C\/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes and other meshing methods will play another central role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering, segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface reconstruction will be provided. Participants are invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical problems occuring when working with large scale 3D point clouds in VR and AR applications.","tags":["imported","myown"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":null,"isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/28b017326319d03834e90bc7f733eba1c\/dblp","author":["Jean-Christophe Morg\u00e8re"],"text":"Mobile augmented reality system for maritime navigation.

Man neigt dazu, das Bild der Holobench aus Star Trek in die Realit\u00e4t zu \u00fcbertragen. Virtuelle Objekte schmiegen sich perfekt in die Realit\u00e4t ein und sind nicht mehr von anderen zu unterscheiden. Die Zukunft ist nicht vorherzusehen, aber in den kommenden Jahren werden virtuelle Objekte noch als solche erkennbar sein. Sie werden nicht genau platziert sein, werden hier und da im Bild springen und nicht die plastische Tiefe von echten Gegenst\u00e4nden haben. Wie bei der VR sind die Erwartungen sehr hoch gesteckt und mit den in Augenblick zu Verf\u00fcgung stehenden Mitteln nicht erreichbar. Es mag zu erwarten sein, dass die Kosten f\u00fcr qualitativ hochwertige Ausr\u00fcstung und der zeitliche Aufwand, um ein AR-System in Betrieb zu nehmen, in den kommenden Jahren sinken.

Luczak"],"text":"Evaluation von AR-Realisierungen in der Produktion","year":"2004","abstract":"Im Produktionsbereich bilden Montaget\u00e4tigkeiten am Ende der Produktionskette einen sehr wichtigen Bestandteil der Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette. Landau et al. (2001) schreiben von \u00fcber einer Million Montagearbeitspl\u00e4tzen in der Fahrzeug- und Elektroindustrie sowie im Maschinen und Anlagenbau. Auch die manuelle Montage ist in vielen Bereichen der Industrie weit verbreitet, sie stellt einen wesentlichen Bestandteil der Produktions- und Servicebereiche der in diesem Sektor arbeitenden Unternehmen dar. Mit dem Aufkommen von Augmented Reality (AR) als neuer Form der Mensch-Rechner-Interaktion er\u00f6ffnen sich Potentiale zur Unterst\u00fctzung an Montagearbeitspl\u00e4tzen, die sich auch auf die Arbeitsorganisation auswirken. Gegenstand dieses Kapitels ist die Untersuchung von AR-Systemen unter m\u00f6glichst realistischen Bedingungen an realen Montagearbeitspl\u00e4tzen. Im Gegensatz zu den bei Wiedenmaier (2004) beschrieben quantitativen Untersuchungen zur Einsetzbarkeit von AR-Technologien in der manuellen Montage und der quantitativen Evaluation von verbesserten Darstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten von virtuellen Objekten gehen die hier gew\u00e4hlten Beispiele auf einem qualitativen Niveau einen Schritt weiter. In den beiden Montageszenarien werden alle Arbeitst\u00e4tigkeiten und damit die gesamten Arbeitspl\u00e4tze neu gestaltet und mit den zuk\u00fcnftigen Arbeitspersonen qualitativ evaluiert. Ein weiterer interessanter Ansatz ist der einer Produktion vorgelagerte Bereich der kooperativen Anlagenplanung. Dabei k\u00f6nnen Kooperationspartner aus verschiedenen, r\u00e4umlich verteilten Unternehmensteilen oder einzelnen Unternehmen eine Produktionsanlage planen. Der Evaluationsfokus liegt im Bereich der Wirtschaftlichkeit eines Einsatzes von AR-Netcollaboration. Im Gegensatz zu den beiden Montageszenarien, bei denen aufgrund der permanenten Arbeit mit den AR-Systemen das Usability Engineering im Mittelpunkt steht, wird hier vor allem die Zeit- und Kostenersparnis in den Vordergrund gestellt. Dennoch darf auf bei der kooperativen Anlagenplanung die Benutzbarkeit nicht au\u00dfer Acht gelassen werden.","tags":["Augmented_Reality","Montage","Arbeitssystemgestaltung","ARVIKA","mmspub","Produktion"],"pub-type":"incollection","publisher":"VDI-Verlag","isbn":null,"url":""},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2bc1c93469bf438ff7479783fc3665e30\/dblp","author":["Maki Sugimoto","Georges Kagotani","Minoru Kojima","Hideaki Nii","Akihiro Nakamura","Masahiko Inami"],"text":"Augmented coliseum: display-based computing for augmented reality inspiration computing robot.","year":"2005","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/siggraph\/siggraph2005et.html#SugimotoKKNNI05"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d21da8da4c459a0d085a0db12523136b\/dblp","author":["Patrick Maier","Gudrun Klinker"],"text":"Augmented chemical reactions: An augmented reality tool to support chemistry teaching.","year":"2013","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"IEEE","isbn":null,"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/expat\/expat2013.html#0002K13"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/29a018142b45f232b79b36f35a090babb\/dblp","author":["Patrick Reipschl\u00e4ger","Severin Engert","Raimund Dachselt"],"text":"Augmented Displays: Seamlessly Extending Interactive Surfaces With Head-Mounted Augmented Reality.","year":"2020","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"9781450368193","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/chi\/chi2020a.html#ReipschlagerED20"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/213fac040c3d032418d3a102203659916\/dblp","author":["Mengu Sukan","Steven Feiner"],"text":"Using augmented snapshots for viewpoint switching and manipulation in augmented reality.","year":"2012","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"pub-type":"inproceedings","publisher":"ACM","isbn":"9781450310161","url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/chi\/chi2012a.html#SukanF12"},{"search_string":"augmented reality","docno":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/249beb3b10fbd290cc986ed533e85d8c8\/dblp","author":["Kuo-Ting Huang","Christopher Ball","Jessica Francis","Rabindra A.
